Pulling me away from my Steam-induced forced gaming sessions...how professional this site's become.  Anyway, here we are.  Color was last month's topic, and color is the topic of this post!  Here are some of the many and varied posts we made this month on the most colorful of topics.

-Olivia wrote a <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/dyeing-the-soul-an-exploration-of-color-5285/">general exploration of the theme</a>, looking at how colors make a game have soul.  Here's where I make a pithy remark about how if games had souls we shouldn't break disks, but that's neither here nor there.

-Stefan gave a think to <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/color-coded-6463/">color as signifier</a>, either of elements or meters.  Health is red.  Remember.  Health is red.  Unless you're poisoned.  Then it's green.  Or maybe purple.

-<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/growing-up-in-color-5996/">Tim composed a great retrospective of color in consoles</a>, focusing on the arcades, the virtual boy, and the game boy color in different measures.  Physical colors, therefore.

Alas, neither Fern nor myself got to writing about racism.  We've still got a couple loosely affiliated articles coming on the topic, but that about concludes this one.  Tune in soon (tonight, perhaps?  We'll see!) for July's Omnitopic!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>For many frequenters of gaming sites the topic in question is one that has been brought up many times: Is digital distribution the salvation of PC games? Probably, yes, but could digital distribution be taken even further? But in case you, dear reader, have just awoken from a decade-long cryostasis, here's a recap of why such a preposterous claim can be made.It wasn't written in the stars that fabled developer Valve's digital game distribution service, Steam, would come to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%2Fforums%2Fread%2F7.156632-Steam-Is-70-of-PC-Digital-Distribution-Market%3Fpage%3D1" target="_blank">dominate</a> the PC gaming market, with over 70% of digital sales, although it has lost some of its market share in the last year, according to a <a href="http://www.pressking.com/press-releases/Digital-distribution-giant-Steam-loses-market-share-to-Amazon-GameStop-and-Microsoft--003683">study</a> by deals4download. It had a fairly modest library of games, suffered from some technical problems, in addition to being perceived as intrusive. Over the years the library grew, and now features most major new releases as well games from smaller developers. Other similar sites, such as Impulse, Direct2Drive and GamersGate have not received the same success, although a service such as GoodOldGames has managed to acquire some success on an otherwise merciless market by finding their own niche.&nbsp;

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Market-share.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6714" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Market-share.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="401" /></a>

The key to Steam's success and popularity can be found in four major factors. Firstly, it is an easy and manageable way to keep an overview of your game collection, which also prevents the annoyance one would feel if a game disc were to disappear. Secondly, it's easier for the buyer to simply enter his credit card information and press purchase, than it is to go down to the nearest video game store and find a physical copy. Thirdly, there are regularly enormous sales on new games, making it more attractive for the consumer to purchase digitally than in physical shops where such sales are a rarity, This, according to Valve founder Gabe Newell, actually leads to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fvalve-gabe-newell-school-interview-digital-sales-dyce-68763%2F" target="_blank">increased sales</a>, claiming that if they reduce the price of a game with 75%, their gross revenue would be increased "by a factor of 40". Fourth, Steam was simply one of the first on the market and thus managed to catch many gamers early on, before the digital gaming craze began, partly because of them requiring Steam to register Valve games, thus reaping in a rather large crowd. In addition, it gives independent developers a platform to reach a broader audience side by side with major titles. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockpapershotgun.com%2F2009%2F10%2F12%2Fthe-steamy-issue-of-digital-distribution%2F" target="_blank">An opportunity they would not have</a> if they had to go through regular publishers and retailers. But while Steam is undeniable a great addition for the PC market, the film market has long been graced with the presence of an interesting service that ambitious newcomers to digital distribution should study if they wish to break the near-monopoly Steam has.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/netflix-logo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6708" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/netflix-logo.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="200" /></a>

You lucky Americans and Canadians have access to one of the most successful digital film distribution networks. Netflix. In 2009 it passed <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fnetflix.mediaroom.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D43%26item%3D307" target="_blank">10 million subscribers</a> and according to the latest figures, 61% of all streamed films are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fsix-10-movies-streamed-netflix-167705" target="_blank">streamed</a> through Netflix, placing it far ahead of Comcast, with a mere 8%. Netflix works in a subscription-based manner, in which the viewer pays a fairly small fee each month and in return receives access to a large library of films. That sounds terribly nice, doesn't it? Could such things exist in the world PC gaming? Video game rentals are nothing new, with a service such as Gamefly being quite well-known, although it only deals with console games, but nothing entirely similar to Gamefly and Netflix has ever existed for PC gaming. Wait, there is?</ul>
<ul><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gametap-logo-green-425px.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6709" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gametap-logo-green-425px.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="319" /></a>&nbsp;

Gametap was launched in 2005, and offers a wide range of games, from fairly new and of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gametap.com%2Fdownload-video-games%2Fpc-games-Assassin%2527s-Creed-20001236-13.html" target="_blank">fair quality games</a> to the downright <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gametap.com%2Fdownload-video-games%2Fpc-games-Rail-Cargo-Simulator-50789999-16.html" target="_blank">cringe-worthy</a>. Like Netflix it is subscription-based service, and gives the user access to hundreds of games, all for a relatively modest amount of money. Doesn't it sound grand? Like a gift to the consumer? Then why aren't we all using it right now? I wish I could attribute it solely to obscurity, but my trial period at Gametap was one of silent frustration. The menus were hard to navigate, slow to respond and the interface just seemed clunky and not very user-friendly, plus the amount of awful games was staggering. Also, I often experienced strange problems when downloading games, such as games simply disappearing from my download queue. That said, the games usually ran quite well once they were downloaded. When I tried to cancel my subscription, as you have to subscribe before you receive a free trial, it was agonizingly annoying and needlessly demanding way of doing so, that instead prompted me to just contact them directly through email, rather than a simple "end the pain!"-button. In my quest for cheaper gaming experiences I also tried Metaboli, a similar service which actually owns Gametap, and experienced the same trials. I suppose they were a bad influence.

In addition, the economical benefits for the developers/publishers are unclear, but they must be big enough to make large publishers like Ubisoft bother making their games available to the service. But that may explain one of the biggest weaknesses of Gametap, namely that it mainly features somewhat older games, making them available only many years after their original release. Only when publishers are assured that they cannot sell more copies of the game in regular stores do they let services like Gametap feast on the carrion. This is also evident from the Download to Own section that Gametap offers, which looks exactly like any other digital distribution site without the added benefit of sleekness and ease of management.

As long as it is economically unfeasible for publishers to let services like these have access to their games, we will never get a Steam-worthy library of games available to us in a Netflix-like service. But could such a service be devised? I'm not sure, but here's an idea: The publisher could be paid on a per-download basis, meaning that every time a subscriber downloads a game, the developer receives a certain amount of money, depending on the age of the game and so on. I suspect that's how it functions at the moment, but evidently it must be done in such a way that it doesn't pay off for the developers to release fairly new games on Gametap that still stand a chance of selling in stores. The benefits of a service like the one described are many: the consumer would be content that he/she could download the latest blockbuster game close to the day of its release for a fraction of the money they'd otherwise spend, and the developer could rejoice in knowing that they would get roughly the same money as they would by selling it retail, and possibly more as an increased number of people would download it on release day.. In addition, more obscure games would have a higher chances of being played as gamers would be more liable to take chances. The real loser in such a scenario is the owner of the download service. How exactly would they pay for all those downloads? The only ways I imagine they could be able to pay for it, would be to limit every user to a certain amount of downloads per month, base it on some form of credit system, or increase subscription fees. All three could possibly scare away potential customers.

Ultimately, it's an extremely complex case with countless variables and specifics that are not immediately visible in a solely hypothetical scenario such as the above. Do you have any ideas on the subject? Then, by all means, post them in the comments below!

Although I do love all the benefits that digital distribution grants the consumer, there is one minor thing that bothers me about the age of digital gaming. The lack of game cases. I suppose I just love collecting things, love putting things on a shelf and recall the many fond experiences when I gaze upon them. There's something oddly satisfying about finishing a game, putting the disc back in the case and placing on the shelf. However, there doesn't seem to be any doubt that digital gaming is the future of the PC, and ultimately I'd rather see newer, fresher, better experiences in the world of games than wallow in nostalgia.</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, this takes the...cake on intricate, almost ridiculous easter eggs. I've yet to see anything in a game that compares to how detailed and crazy this easter egg is, anyway. Watch as two girls playing L4D2 stumble upon a Portal 2 easter egg that takes them to the Aperture Science labs, allows them to think with portals, and, of course, listen to GlaDoS berate them.

		<title>Google+ Code Hints At Social Games</title>

Suddenly, <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/google-will-be-developing-social-games-6389/">Google's intent to create social games</a> makes sense: the games will probably be for their newly released service, Google+.

<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/30/google-code-reveals-intent-to-unleash-games-and-questions-to-th?icid=sphere_searchsphere_news">Found hidden in the source code for the service</a> are lines that indicate that people will be able to send and receive invites for 'Google+ Games.' Social games on the service seems like an inevitability considering that Facebook has made the feature a staple.

The real question is, then, how good will the games that Google unleashes be?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Developed almost entirely in the spare time of Joost Van Dongen over a  period of six years, Proun, an abstract racing game, has finally been  released for download.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-6829" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/review-proun-6828/proun-screen3/"><img class="size-full wp-image-6829 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Proun-Screen3.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></a>

Based on the abstract designs of artists like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wassilykandinsky.net%2F" target="_blank">Kandinsky</a> and the Proun works of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.turkcebilgi.com%2FEl%2BLissitzky" target="_blank">El Lissitzky</a> for which it was named, Proun is built on a concept not often seen in games. It is a strong ally in the argument of games as art, in the most basic of ways. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dutchdailynews.com%2Fproun%2F" target="_blank">It has been shown in various high-end art galleries</a> for its artistic nature, and is definitely unique and fun to look at and play.

In  Proun, you and similar spherical polygons race along a defined rail  through a beautiful and uniquely abstract landscape, dodging the  environment with no real sense of gravity to gain as much speed as  possible so you can win over your competitors.  But the look of this game is  what defines it. It gives the game a very nice atmosphere, and makes you  want to see more of it, despite there being absolutely no story.

Being  a racing game at its heart, I don't mind there being no story, but I  expected there to be more to do to give it a reason to play beyond a  story to follow.  And there just isn't a whole lot to do in the game. Though I love the  tracks that are included, there really aren't that many. There are five  total, one of which has to be unlocked and another that you only get if  you pay at least two dollars for the game (which I'll discuss later).  You can get more if you download user-made ones from the site, however. I  have nothing against user-generated content in games, but this is  definitely a downside. Three to five maps isn't many to include in the  main game, and there are no tools for you to make your own unless you're  a programming-savvy modder. I would have been much more satisfied with  the game if there were either more maps or some easy way included for me  to make my own, since unlocking the fourth map is difficult and I have  yet to pay for the fifth.

There are also not many modes. There's  "Championship"--where you play through a few of the tracks, racing with  AI to get as high of a placement as you can to earn enough points to  win. There's also "Single Race", which is self-explanatory, and "Time  Trial", where you race ghosts of your previous runs to try and beat your  own best times. These modes are great and all, but less than I would  expect. It would be nice to at least see some online multiplayer: you  can do up to four player splitscreen in Single Race, but it has to be  hotseat. This is a bit of a letdown, especially for a racing game, which  are usually fairly social. The most online interaction that you get in  the game are the leaderboards, which let you know your standing after  any run you do.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-6831" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/review-proun-6828/proun-screen2/"><img class="size-full wp-image-6831 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Proun-Screen2.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></a>

However, I do like the different difficulties in  the game. It goes from "fast" to "sonic" to "supersonic" to "speed of  light", all obviously affecting the speed at which you move. This gives  Proun a level challenge that can get to be frustrating, as the AI  doesn't seem to have any trouble adapting to the speed change. But with a  bit of practice and experimentation, Proun can be mastered. Though even  a small flaw in your strategy can put you behind, it almost never seems  like victory is out of reach. With the right amount of fidgeting, you  can always work you way back up. This adds a nice amount of balance to  the game, and prevents most players from getting angry and quitting.

But  as said before, there isn't that much in Proun to be had besides the  unique setting. And though Proun was designed to be very simple and  accessible, that is a bit of a setback for the more hardcore gamers that  will be playing Proun. The controls simply use forward, back, left, and  right commands, and there are no ways to hinder or otherwise interact   with your opponents. You can't even run into them and throw them off  course; you just move right through them. And since there is very little  interaction, it sometimes feels like the player is just racing by  themselves, occasionally seeing a different-colored sphere swiftly roll  by them, changing their placement in the race but otherwise having no  effect. In a racing game, it's important to have tangible foes for you  to be racing against, and though the gameplay of Proun is fun, it isn't  engaging. The environment itself is the only opponent that you have to  worry about beating. Though some would argue that the environment is  dangerous enough as it is, I beg to differ. It's a racing game. I want  something to race.

Now,  it's hard not to cut this game any slack.  The setting is awesome, and the music is suitably brilliant. But even  though this was simply a spare time project, six years of spare time  adds up to a lot of time, even with long breaks, and Proun ends up  coming off as a really pretty, well-made flash game that would be found  somewhere deep in boredom-land. The gameplay is enjoyable, but there is  only so much fun to be had when there is only so much to do.

Regardless  of your opinion on the game, you can't complain much. Proun has a "pay  what you want" policy, meaning exactly what it says. If you want you can  download for free, and if you're feeling generous you could pay for Van  Dongen's new house. It's all up to the player, and how much they feel  the game is worth. And if you download it for free and decide you would  like to pay something for it at a later date, you can do just that by  simply re-purchasing the game. Of course, a bonus track is thrown in for  some extra incentive to pay, but other than that you get the entirety  of the game, no matter how many coins you put on the table.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-6830" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/review-proun-6828/proun-screen1/"><img class="size-full wp-image-6830 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Proun-Screen1.png" alt="" width="654" height="384" /></a>

So  even though Proun isn't the most satisfying game out there, it  definitely brings a lot of uniqueness to the racing genre. The artistic  level design is exciting and fun, and is great for a casual change of  pace. As long as you look at Proun for what it is, it's definitely new,  innovative, and full of spark. It has its flaws and faults, but Proun  was made upon a basis of art, and as art is subjective, Proun itself may  prove to be equally subjective.

Kandinsky would be proud.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I loved Red Dead Redemption. Let's just get that out-of-the-way. I did everything; tamed every horse, did every side-quest possible and upon entering Mexico and that beautiful song played â€“ Jose Gonzalez's Far Away â€“ I threw my controller across the room to not interrupt the love being made to my ears.

From start to finish I was engrossed, but where the game truly shined was the ending. The whole game culminated in this final scene that left me staring at the credits in contemplation, and not like Assassin's Creed where I'm just staring because I have no idea what just happened.

Not everybody agrees with me about the ending of RDR, so this piece will serve as a bit of a rebuttal to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fnightmaremode.net%2F2011%2F06%2Fwhoever-wrote-the-ending-to-red-dead-redemption-is-one-dumb-cowpoke-6020%2F" target="_blank">this article</a>, offering a different interpretation of the ending. This will also, if you haven't already realized, be spoiler heavy. So... play the game first, because you'll kick yourself to have it spoiled.

Redemption, it's in the title. This game has one of the most poignant and accurate representations of redemption that I've experienced in any medium. Though RDR stands in comparison to Western films who address the same topic, the interactivity that it bestows makes the experience stronger than anywhere else.

John Marston seeks redemption. Not for his conscience, but because he is forced to do so to earn his family's freedom. He spends most of the plot seeking the former members of his gang and hunting them down at the behest of the FBI. By killing those who left him for dead, he not only gets revenge for what they did to him, but redemption for his actions as an outlaw.

The effort that John Marston exerts in his quest for redemption is not for his own benefit, or even for his wife Abigail's; it is for his son, Jack. John and Abigail speak several times about their desire for Jack to live a life as far removed as possible from their own: The Marstons lived their earlier years as outlaws, robbing banks and killing people. Many often question John about how he managed to justify his actions as a law-breaker and he responds that he was kinda like Robin Hood stealing from the wealthy and undeserving and helping out those that needed it. This justification isn't held up by the members of their gang or by the FBI, however. It does seem as though John and Abigail honestly regret their criminal life, John states that he had to live the way [he did], and that he was in awe of Dutch just like everyone else was. Ultimately, however you look at it, John Marston was a man trying to live by pretending the things he'd done didn't happen. It is difficult to imagine that John could really believe that he would be allowed to walk away unharmed and free.

However, by what we assume to be the end of the game, John has finished. He has as good as killed Dutch, fulfilled his obligation to the FBI and earned his freedom. He's finally allowed to return to his farm with his family and live out the rest of his days as a peaceful ranch-owner. Besides shooting Elk and bears, as well as the occasional cattle-rustler, John Marston will likely never have to pull his gun out in anger again.

Honestly? I thought that was it. I thought that I'd get a rather cheesy, happy ending with the whole family together forever. Thankfully, I was mistaken. We return home, and we still pursue missions. They're calm, tranquil and are essentially the same missions from the beginning of the game back at the MacFarlane Ranch. We hunt with Jack, we shoot crows off of the grain silo and we ride with the Missus.

After several conversations and missions with the Marston family however, I realize that it's all a lead-up. The moment where I consciously realized that these missions were happy and peaceful for a reason was when I knew that the Marston's weren't going to get a happy ending.

I loved that.

I know the John Marston was the protagonist and, at the end of the day, he isn't a criminal anymore. He simply wants to go home to his family and live a quiet life. But in the big picture, that's just not how it works. John was, and still is, a criminal. He's killed countless people even before the game begins. Unfortunately, you don't get to leave all that behind and start anew. As much as that might be seen as the right thing to do â€“ the criminal finally turning over a new leaf â€“ that's just not how it works.

There is a battle fought in the background of the story of Red Dead Redemption between the untamed, wild ways of the West and the encroaching civilization. We play a man who is firmly rooted in the self-sufficient, anti-government mentality that so many people felt in the West. These people settled and tamed this wild land, turning it from a dangerous and desolate area into a blend of nature and civilization. With the onset of the railroad, people were able to come and go so much more easily, enabling government influence to extend into corners of the country previously untouched. This was not met with glee; throughout RDR many characters blame any and all bad occurrences on the government and their interfering ways. These people don't want big government and meddling agents or the large cities and extensive colonization that follow. They want their quiet, settled life with strong familial ties and their self-sufficiency. They wish to deal with things in their own way.

Under this model of life, it is understandable for John to walk away from his actions. After all, he has helped many communities, sheriffs and even revolutions, hopefully working towards saving lives. These actions should redeem John Marston from the errors he's made and the people he has killed. If there were no government or code of law, perhaps that would be the case.

But the government does exist, and the people who get left from the killings want justice. And so John Marston, having ignored Dutch's warning that they'll never leave people like us alone, finds his farm under attack by waves of US forces, all trying to kill the entire family. As the player, I was confused about why they would attack. I expected something tragic to happen, but I didn't necessarily expect the FBI would double cross him.

I later came to the realization that they had to kill him. The FBI was determined on rooting out all bandit and outlaw gangs. They set out to eradicate the entirety of Dutch van der Linde's gang, and John Marston was the last. If they let him live, they would be undermining their very mission; preserving the peace and delivering justice. True, it might seem that, as John was the protagonist and he's performed so many good actions, he should be allowed to go free. That can't be, because the people want justice. The media desires justice. The game paints the government agents â€“ and the government as a whole, really â€“ as malicious and self-serving, not doing what is right, but merely what is most likely to win them acclaim and get them promoted. True, the FBI seem more concerned about how it would make them look if they fail, but that feeling of shame is closely tied to the expectations of the people who were hurt, either directly or indirectly, by John Marston and his gang.

During the game, the player can play John Marston either good or bad, making choices in select missions about how you act. It's relatively minor, as no matter what John Marston is concerned with getting back to his family. The way you play him also doesn't really matter except for an individual player's view on John's character. Either you play him as a reformed criminal trying his best to get peace and choose good options, or you play him as a jackass who only left crime to start his family, but is still perfectly happy to let that damn cannibal eat whomever he likes.

All comments about the conflict between civilization and the wild aside, Red Dead Redemption is fundamentally about John Marston's redemption. He quests for it by hunting his former allies and both he and the player believe that he has finally earned it once they are all dead.

However, the actions of John Marston will forever haunt him; just because he hunted his former gang won't stop law enforcement wanting his blood. They don't want to just kill John, but his family as well. They will never be safe until the FBI finally kills John Marston. And at the end, once John finds himself surrounded and with no safe way out, he knows it.

Marston finally realizes what he has been hiding from himself the entire game: that he can never gain redemption for his actions while he is still alive. No matter what he does to try to clear his name, he will always be hunted, and by extension so will his family. John's primary focus is to preserve the innocence and ability in his son and to let him live a life free from his own past. But as long as John Marston lives, that can never be true.

I genuinely felt that John Marston fully comes to terms with his fate trapped in that barn. He and his family have made it into relative safety. He could grab a horse and ride away with his family, shooting down the FBI as he went. He could go to New Austin to gather support or to find a place to hide. Or maybe he could go to Mexico, get Abraham Reyes, the revolutionary whose quest for the crown only managed to get a start thanks to John. He could be safe there, right?

Hardly. He would be hunted down. No matter where he went, he would be a wanted man, never free. That probably wouldn't bother John Marston; he's been like that all his life. But his son would suffer. He would never live a life of his own, free to do what he wants without fear of suddenly being surrounded by the army, or mercenaries or bounty hunters or whoever.

So John Marston sends his family away, steps outside the barn doors guns blazing like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, knowing that he'll die. His death brings freedom to his wife and son; they won't be hunted by the FBI, they're of no concern to the government. By sacrificing himself to save his son's future, John Marston finally achieves redemption. His life, filled with crime and murder, has at last been absolved through his self-sacrifice for the good of his son.

The final twist to the whole thing is that Jack Marston becomes just like his father. You re-enter the game 3 years later, after the death of Abigail. Jack looks just like his father, bar a stunning facial resemblance to Johnny Depp, and has become exactly what John didn't want him to be. We have no clue what to do with Jack, only an odd stranger mission off in Blackwater that becomes Jack's short quest to get revenge on Edgar Ross, the FBI boss who ordered John's betrayal and murder.

Jack follows leads â€“ under the guise of a simple message carrier â€“ until finally finding Edgar Ross at a convenient river far away from anyone. He duels him, and kills him. And with that last killing, Jack turns away and Red Dead Redemption is slashed across the screen. This saddening ending, and indeed the whole game, is a wonderful example of eventual true, honest redemption that unfortunately goes wrong.

A lovely touch exists that I feel further expands on the monster that Jack Marston has become exists after the end of the game. During the game you can buy newspapers throughout the plot, often with references to John Marston's exploits. At the end of the game, you can buy only one more. It has an article about the death of Edgar Ross, and it assumes his death was a result of hold-up by robbers because money he had on him before he died that wasn't on his body.

When you shoot Edgar Ross, you can decide whether to go up to his body and search it; if you did, you'd receive $200 he had on him. This seems like nothing at the time, but the newspaper seems to establish it as canon that Jack Marston robbed this man's corpse for any money left on him. When you do it as part of the game, you tend to not really think about the fact that you're essentially stealing any final possessions on a man you've just killed, but reading that Jack took the money just cements him as exactly what John never wanted his son to be.

Just like him.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>A factor in many reviewers' judgment of any given game is the length of time it takes for them to complete it. However, the focus often seems to be on the amount of the content rather than the quality of the content. A game that was fairly well-received by critics, and was of considerable length, even though some will wail and cry that it did not live up to its predecessor, was Dragon Age 2. However, the extensive length of the game was a mere illusion, conjured from its over-reliance on repetitive combat, intended to make the player's journey appear longer and feel more epic in scope.&nbsp;

Dragon Age 2 makes two cardinal sins in its futile attempt to artificially lengthen the game. Both of them serve only to highlight its unimaginative design. Firstly, most enemy encounters are merely hack-&amp;-slash fests, featuring dozens of enemy soldiers in high speed, fluid combat, rather than the mostly thoughtful encounters seen in Origins, with the only notable exception being a section in the Deep Roads. In addition to that, enemies would regularly <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-A0sZOGzQJw" target="_blank">spawn in the middle of a fight</a>, without any rational explanation to how they got there. While the tactical combat in Origins could easily become sluggish due to the occasional overabundance of it, the developers had at least realized their game stood much stronger with a tactical combat system, rather than a boiled-down action-combat system as the one seen in DA2, which requires a minimal amount of tactical and strategic thinking. Why the same developers decided to create two such a drastically combat system puzzles as well as saddens me.

A game that succeeded in creating the above, without relying on unsatisfying combat to fill the gaps that the above-mentioned points should cover, is Planescape: Torment. Torment is well-known for the fact that a significant amount of the combat in the game can be avoided, particularly through dialogue, and relies more on what the player shapes the Nameless One into, and how the player through his exploration of the mysterious City of Doors, Sigil, slowly unveils the Nameless One's history and background. Combat mostly becomes peripheral, and even in the very last, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamebanshee.com%2Fplanescapetorment%2Fwalkthrough%2Ffortressroof.php" target="_blank">climactic encounter</a> it is even possible to resolve it through dialogue or other non-combat means. The characters you did fight seemed like actual people, with their own raison d'etre and this made the encounters a more special experience, and that is one central point to creating satisfying combat encounters. As Joss Whedon comments on his <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fdannystack.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F01%2Fjoss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips.html" target="_blank">blog</a> on screenwriting tips, no character should feel like he/she is only a placeholder to move the story on. Every character, even measly a measly non-essential NPC, has to be unique in some sense. While a player who has maximized the Nameless One's Strength can easily complete the game and get and get an enjoyable experience out of it, emphasizing other non-violent skills encourages a different style of play, rather than simple bashing. Without using filler combat to enhance the game's length, Torment still managed to give the appearance of an epic and character-changing journey, and is today regarded as the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Fgame%2Fpc%2Fplanescape-torment" target="_blank">one of best  RPGs</a> to see the light of day.</ul>
<ul><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Planescape.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6938" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Planescape.gif" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>&nbsp;

The second cardinal sin that Dragon Age 2 made can be found in the level design. Players have to navigate the old caverns, sewers and dungeons <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%2Farticles%2Fview%2Fcomics%2Fcritical-miss%2F8730-Critical-Miss-Erin-Hawke-Explorer" target="_blank">a million times over</a>. Only minor things were changed in the areas when revisited--corridors being blocked off, and objects being added, removed or changed altogether. But any 'seasoned' map reader could deduce that this cavern was designed almost exactly like the one before it. Another location this was particularly noticeable in was the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.wikia.com%2Fdragonage%2Fimages%2F8%2F8f%2FWounded_coast_map.jpg" target="_blank">Wounded Coast</a>, in which a rather large amount of the quests, side as well as main, took place. Every time the player returned to this locale, the map would return to a blank slate, as if he/she had never been there before. Essentially there's no harm in reusing core locales, for example revisiting the same districts of Kirkwall, the city in which most of the game takes place, wouldn't feel old as long as the same minor areas weren't reused as well.

Bioware, the developer of DA2, released a game a decade ago that succeeded far better at making its level design feel unique. Baldur's Gate 2. Due to its <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamebanshee.com%2Fbaldursgateii%2Fwalkthrough%2Fimages%2Far1100.jpg" target="_blank">hand-painted</a> backgrounds, that easily rival advanced, but barren 3D visuals, every location becomes <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamebanshee.com%2Fbaldursgateii%2Fwalkthrough%2Fimages%2Far1200.jpg" target="_blank">unique</a> as a consequence (check out the walkthrough at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamebanshee.com%2Fbaldursgateii%2Fwalkthrough.php" target="_blank">Gamebanshee</a>, there are plenty of more map images that showcase this). In addition, the maps were open-ended, as evidenced by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamebanshee.com%2Fbaldursgateii%2Fwalkthrough%2Fimages%2Far0602.jpg" target="_blank">the very first dungeon you find yourself in</a>, and filled to the brim with not necessarily connected quests, whereas the locations in DA2 were far more like to have the player start at one end of the area, and then fight his way to the other end without

Unifying for the examples stated is that for a game to succeed at creating genuine length, as opposed to bloated mess of DA2, practically every encounter and area needs to be unique in some sense for the epic journey to save the world to actually feel epic. But should length even be required aspirations for games? At the other end of the spectrum of length we find two experiments. DICE's Mirror's Edge and Valve's Portal. One of them benefits greatly from its short length, the other doesn't. Care to guess?</ul>
<ul><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Mirrors-Edge.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6933" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Mirrors-Edge-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>&nbsp;

Mirror's Edge was a wonderful little experimental parkour first-person game. I won't call it a shooter, but rather an FPG, as the shooting parts were fairly uncommon, and could (and should) generally be avoided. The player takes the role of courier Faith, who runs packages through a dystopian city for a slightly shady boss. Naturally, this doesn't please the rulers, and through some fairly intense chases Faith has to evade enemy police officers ultimately unraveling a deeper conspiracy and saving her sister. The game can be completed in the span of a few hours, whereafter you can delete the game and go on to something else. Only the game ends so abruptly and quickly before you can truly achieve that immersion. It doesn't feel like there's any form of closure. It's merely a lead-up to a sequel.

Then we have Portal, widely loved for its dark humor and wonderful personality. In about the same time span as Mirror's Edge, or less if my memory is correct, Portal delivers one of the most memorable rides in video game history. Even among people who otherwise loathe short games, I've seen fondness for this one. Why? Because it delivers everything it has on its mind in a few hours and secondly because it gives closure. It doesn't feel like we've been robbed of some hidden experience after we've finished the game. Sure, we've just received a sequel to it, but there wasn't anything directly leading up to it. The only thing a sequel could really is explore things hinted at during the first one (note: I haven't played Portal 2 yet, so cannot comment on the contents). If the first Portal hadn't been a huge success, Valve could've just quietly not made a sequel, and even fans of the first one wouldn't feel cheated that they didn't get the full story.

What differentiates the two games in terms of closing the story is that Mirror's Edge leaves the objective uncompleted, whereas the objective in Portal, i.e. destroying GLaDOS, has been achieved.

There can be no doubt that a large part of the reason to Portal's success, was that it was part of the Orange Box, served as a neat little exotic dessert once the player was done with Half-Life 2, and tired of Team Fortress 2. This brings to another widely used argument against the shortness of games. The economic one. "Why should you pay 60$ for a 6-hour game! That's preposterous!" Such sentiments are understandable, but also in part a sign of McDonaldization of society, more specifically <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcdonaldization.com%2Fcalculability.shtml" target="_blank">calculability</a>, in which the argument is that "more is better" and the consumer quantifies the enjoyment one would get out of. Indeed, often there's just too little content in those games to justify a purchase, or they go the Mirror's Edge route and tack on a few challenges to extend the life span, but ultimately you need to judge the gaming experience not through the time you've spent on it, but through the joy, beauty and enlightenment it has brought you.  Don't judge an experience on the length of it, but rather the quality of it. Most people probably cherish the memory of their first kiss or a particularly awesome rollercoaster ride more than a half-decent rerun of fair TV-show that has brought them some, but not that much enjoyment, even though the rerun might have lasted longer. Extending a game's length unnaturally with filler is, like I've written, just like spreading the quality and innovation over a larger area. The butter is spread thinner, and the toast is saddened.</ul>
<ul><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Portal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6944" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Portal-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>&nbsp;

I think Braid creator Jonathan Blow said it perfectly in his blog: Why can't video games give me a powerful, high-density experience, so that after 3 hours I am satisfied, I feel like I have had enough? Wouldn't that be cool?" Read the full post (just a short snippet) <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fthe-witness.net%2Fnews%2F%3Fp%3D438" target="_blank">here</a>, where there are also more links to other comments regarding short games. Like Jonathan Blow I am in no way trying to dismiss long games, only the people who blindly dismiss short games based mostly on the quantity of the content. There are many other critical points that can be raised against some shorter games, but length should not be one of them. Judge them like you would any other game.

Lastly, if the video game business is going to achieve greater acceptance in general society as anything else than casual distraction games, I think we need to embrace the shorter format. If we are to lure in anyone who has not in some way grown up with video games, they need to not occupy tens of hours of those people's lives. Length should preferably not be a factor when the critics' harsh judgment falls over a game, as it is rarely directly responsible for a game's true quality. Instead, the quality is found in the game's ability to create unique and memorable experiences.</ul>

(We're only running a week or so late.  Blame Steam!  Steam, father of all lies!  Mother of all untruths!)

Video games are about power.  When we have power, we have fun, or so the story goes.  Power lets us do what we want, when we want, and it's what makes us love games where we don't love other media.  In a film, you can't be powerful.  You can watch revenge, but you aren't doing it yourself.  In Grand Theft Auto, those pedestrians you just obliterated with a sixteen wheeler were victims to your power, not to some faceless actors'.

But what about when games take power away from you?  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/8661-Extra-Punctuation-What-if-We-Leveled-Backwards">Yahtzee posted an interesting musing about this phenomenon months ago</a>, and we liked it so much we thought to make it the topic of this month's ubiquitous omnitopic: weakness.

Of course, weakness can involve other things: games we love that we shouldn't, bad games we think about even when we try not to, games that we want to make artificially harder.  All of these are components of weakness, and it's these many angles we'll attack this month.

Okay.  You and weakness, you've been introduced.  Good.  Now I'm off to play Iron Grip: Warlord and Magicka.  Huzzah!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Uncharted 3 Beta Synopsis</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/?p=7271</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you for some reason didn't know by now, the Uncharted 3 Beta is out. The beta runs from July 2nd(or June 28th for lucky early-access people) to July 14th. And while it's not the final product, it's shaping up to be a pretty good online experience.

Featured in the beta are two maps and five game-modes. The maps, Chateau and Airstrip, are well built, visually distinct, and fun to play on. Chateau is centered around a destroyed mansion in the middle of the Jungle, and provides plenty of opportunities to get around enemies. Airstrip is the more interesting map of the two. It starts with one team(hero's) on a plane, and the other(villains) in trucks trying to board said plane. It keeps the action moving and interesting, and it's one hell of a fun time. Sadly it's just a short part of the overall map, and after about 3 minutes or so the plane takes off and you head into a normal, static multiplayer map. Though some interesting things do happen, it's just not as fun as truck-hopping to a plane. The five game-modes are your standard multiplayer fare. Team Deathmatch, Team Objective, Plunder, which is essentially capture the flag, hardcore, which is Team Deathmatch but without gameplay modifiers, and co-op where three humans have to fight off waves of enemies while completing objectives. It's all decently fun, but nothing too special. Along with all this, we can see that character customization has been expanded upon.

[caption id="attachment_7273" align="aligncenter" width="405" caption="Go around!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Uncharted3Airstrip.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7273   " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Uncharted3Airstrip.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="229" /></a>[/caption]

In the beta your offerings are pretty limited, but they hint at how much the final product could include. You can choose  a character to play as, but you can only select between two of the main characters from the story, or choose to be a random treasure hunter/pirate. You can't even really customize the main characters that much, while the treasure hunter/pirate get quite a bit of outfits to choose from. Along with cosmetic stuff, you get to set loadouts. With loadouts, you can choose what weapon to spawn with, and what boosters(think perks) you'll be using. The boosters allow you to switch up your play-style a bit, but don't do anything too drastic. You can also choose a kickback, which is essentially a killstreak. Get a certain amount of medals, and press up on the D-pad to activate it. These can be as simple as spawning a rocket launcher or causing you grenades to split into more grenades, or more fantasticle like kicking up a smoke-screen and teleporting away, or turning into a swarm of spiders. Or that's what it says, at least. It isn't available to players in the beta, instead it sits there. Mocking us, mocking <em>me</em>.
<p style="text-align: center">

[caption id="attachment_7277" align="aligncenter" width="498" caption="Ah... if only..."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Uncharted3Spiders.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7277  " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Uncharted3Spiders.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="217" /></a>[/caption]

</p>
Anyway, another feature in the beta is a cinema mode. Basically you can re-watch past matches, record clips, and do quite a bit of interesting stuff, like change camera angles, focus, tints, and a few other things. Though the recording clips part doesn't seem to be working. When I tried it the clip was just a black screen with sounds over it. Turns out it turns all the display settings of the video to their lowest points. It also doesn't fully follow what you recorded. So yeah, that's broken. I also couldn't find out how to take screenshots. Don't think the beta supports that, which makes me sad since now I can't show you all the awesome gameplay footage.

The beta is more or less a slightly improved version of Uncharted 2's multi-player. The cover-based combat with strong platforming elements are still there, which makes it really fun to move around. Overall, it's shaping up to be  a good experience, though it doesn't do anything that's really different compared to other multiplayer games. Hopefully more maps are like the first part of Airstrip, since that would definitely make things a lot more interesting than they already are.

Still, the beta lasts until July 14th, so if you have a PS3 and want to check it out, go for it!

		<title>This Too Shall Push - A History of Starting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It happened so quickly...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a rel="attachment wp-att-7952" href="http://nightmaremode.net/?attachment_id=7952"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7952" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/StarForceChampLodeTwofer.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="262" /></a><em>Star Force</em>, <em>Lode Runner</em>. The first, a  monumental work among arcade shooters. The second, a well-respected "thinking man's arcade game," as well as being the first game to ship with a level editor. But what do they have to do with one another? Well, for one, both were ported to the Nintendo Famicom in 1985. More important than this though is that they were the first two games to feature the now-ubiquitous Push Start prompt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Well..."Press Start" in <em>Championship Lode Runner's</em> case. This may seem like a pithy remark, but it's actually a pretty important distinction: I excluded dB-Soft's <em>Flappy</em>, which actually released in the two month window that separated CLR and SF, due to the wording of its prompt, "Push Select Button." This point in itself with be of importance a little later. But what's more important right now is how the prompt came about in the first place. In order to answer that, we're gonna have to take the topic 'round the block a few times; let the engine unwind a bit; listen for the sound of the sheer sound of a thing before us...a thing that, like history herself, is untouchable.</p>
The basics most of us already know by now: In the era before the steely grip of the home market (before Nintendo's Quality Crusade reinvigorated the market), the purpose of the title screen was one of a singular purpose: to attract the eyes (and attention) (and quarters) of would-be players, players with myriad other choices all around them. So gamers were given the grand tour: a title screen,  a game's story, high scores, a demo, and--never to be forgotten--the (often flashing) "Insert Coin" prompt. We should not pass over this last point without comment: the ubiquitous "Insert Coin" prompt was, in terms of the experience offered by the machine before the player, a contract. You pay to play. By inserting a coin we begin upon an agreement with the game in question: I will play and you will allow yourself to be played. This era (of experience) decided many of the gameplay mechanics that modern games have only recently begun losing from themselves, such as lives counters, score counters, intense difficulty, and temporary power-ups.

The home market ran parallel to the arcade market, and the majority of games available in the home market were merely ports of arcade games. Which meant that developers were struggling to replace this contract with anything meaningful. This was when games entered a second era...a transitory era...The Superfluous Options Era...the era of Game A or B; of One Player or Two Player; of Level 1/2/3.

There was a reason for this era: developers quickly recognized that games, since they've already been bought and paid for, needed a contract of their own...a passageway between on-but-not-playing and actually playing. Yet in their attempts, developers created games that not only were but felt like false experiences...These early games were merely at-home substitutes. But it wouldn't stay this way for long: Nintendo, without knowing it,  had already created the scheme in which  "experience" would begin to  evolve.
<p style="text-align: justify"><a rel="attachment wp-att-7773" href="http://nightmaremode.net/?attachment_id=7773"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7773" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Start-Button.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="172" /></a>The NES controller, which for many years and through many iterations would come to define the norm, had a button dedicated to "beginning"...the Start button. Previously, the "starting" of a game was done is one of three ways: hitting the reset button; pushing the power button; or using the one button a controller had. Nintendo's choice to look forward towards a more complex future in gaming was important, and struck a nice balance between the single button of competing systems, and the multitude of "buttons" (keys) of a PC keyboard. Even the name of their system implied a fusion of these two ideals: the FAMICOM, or FAMIly COMputer, attempted to find a middle-ground in which to re-invigorate the home console market. And it certainly seems that this conceit informed aspects of the games: arcade developers slowly began making the shift to broader, exploration-based games. And even the Start prompt currently under discussion now was very likely informed by PC games:  the "Press Any Key" prompt had already become commonplace on PCs, and had even been used on several PC games. This is no doubt the reason why the first game to use the phrase "Push Start" was a PC developer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And yet I hesitate to say that the PC invented the prompt...not the PC alone, at least. For one, "Press Any Key," while it performs the same function of "Push Start" (to provide a purgatory for our passage from not playing to playing), the connotations of the PC prompt were quite different. For one, we were missing that all important word, "Start"...a word that promises experience. For two, there was the subtle difference between "pressing" and "pushing"...though the words are commonly thought of as synonyms, we don't "press" a shopping cart through the grocery store; I don't X. For three, "Press Any Key" didn't evolve naturally out of PC games...the prompt was already commonly used. For four, PC games, especially during the era of DOS prompts, were a thread of "startings" even before the game even came on: powering on the computer; inserting the disk; typing through several lines of commands; and only THEN being able to "begin" anything in earnest at all. Which is to say, PC games were a different experience. The console game, while often inferior in terms of capabilities, benefited from the constraint in the area of focus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As well, the evolution of Push Start was seen not in PC ports, but in arcade ports.</p>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-7772" href="http://nightmaremode.net/?attachment_id=7772"><img class="size-full wp-image-7772 alignleft" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tower-of-Druaga.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="216" /></a>In late 1985, Namco three titles that encapsulate the evolution of the prompt. <em>Druaga No Tou</em> (<em>The Tower of Druaga</em>) gave us an option for Start or Continue. Like Star Force, Druaga No Tou was an arcade port, and its title prompt seems to have been a result of the struggling with the difference between the arcade game and the home game. The transition to a home market meant a change in the experience itself...and the games of this era were experimenting with what that meant.

And <em>Pac-Land</em>, like <em>SF</em> and <em>DNT</em>, was a port.

Namco's Star Luster, a game no one's ever heard of, appeared first on the home consoles...only to be ported to the arcades later that month as part of Ninetendo's Vs. Arcade, a platform designed to begin bringing popular home games to the arcade. If we were looking for the breaking point, this would be it.

From the lover's goodbye to the stranger's bedroom; from the rush of the subway platform to the stifling summer swelter; to be human is to be always, all the time, coming from somewhere. And yet, chronology captures only a portion of the reality. There must be something greater than mere chronology behind the reality of the world; more than timelines; for we live in linear time but remember in something else. In the anxiety of memory and linear time, we create another kind of history. We divvy up the world into experience. We turn the objective into the subjective.

I, for instance, remember

<a rel="attachment wp-att-7833" href="http://nightmaremode.net/?attachment_id=7833"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7833" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Legend-of-Zelda-The-E.png" alt="" width="256" height="240" /></a>It's no secret that Shigeru Miyamoto, while developing 1986's <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, cleverly borrowed from half a dozen genres at once, creating one of the most important games of all time. Among these borrowed ideas, perhaps the prompt upon the now-famous title screen has been forgotten. But regardless, it is yet another reason why this game offered players an experience unlike those of the arcade.dlsfkj sdlfkj sdlfjk sdflkjds ldfkjsd flkdsfj dsflksd flsdfkjsdf lsdkf ldsfkj sldfkjsdlk sldkfj sldkfjsldkj sdl sldkfjsdlfk sdlfkjsdflkdsjflskfdjlskjsldkfj lsdkfjlsdkfjsdlsldkfjsldfkj. [Worth mentioning that Dragon's Quest, like Zelda, offered this bigger version of "experience," but the original versions did not have the prompts that the later versions would. Though 2 years later once the American version released, the Press Start prompt was firmly in place.]

&nbsp;

<a rel="attachment wp-att-7830" href="http://nightmaremode.net/?attachment_id=7830"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7830" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Zelda-no-Densetsu-The-Hyrule-Fantasy-Prototype_001.png" alt="" width="256" height="240" /></a>

&nbsp;

For Americans, August 1987 saw the release of a second Press Start...Metroid (technically Press Start <em>Button.</em>) And two years after that, <em>Dragon Warrior</em> forced gamers to listen to a tune before even being presented with the Press Start prompt.

Games began to swiftly exit the Era of Competition...the competition for each coin between each cabinet...the competition of hi-scores that blinked...and in many ways the competition of non-Nintendo entities, so firm had been the Big N's grasp on the throat of the market. We entered into an era of true experience in games. Games that were paid for up-front and required no additional competition until you left the home again to Toys R' Us (or the local video store).

[How then did we re-enter another phase of this era...? DLC? The West/East split?]

The start button signifies the true belonging of games in homes. Previously, the contract had been the insertion of coinageâ€”but Press Start began a new type of contract: the mere willingness to be a part of a world.
<p style="text-align: center"><a rel="attachment wp-att-7881" href="http://nightmaremode.net/?attachment_id=7881"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7881" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/metroidtwopack.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="245" /></a></p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* * *

And yet this mere history doesn't satisfy. By merely trace a path through the evolution of Press Start, I begin to lose grasp of a greater truth, a greater question at play: What <em>exactly</em> does Press Start mean...?

What occurs during our little narrative of thumbs that constitutes a beginning? Is it the cracking open the case to a game, inspecting its manual? Or is it handing over our cold hard cash? Have I been collecting paychecks my whole life for the sole purpose at arriving at <em>Mass Effect 3?</em> Hopefully not.

Well, in some ways it's the beginning of existence. No matter how many times we may have pressed start on Contra, there was still a first time, which is to say, there was a pressing start to pressing start. In Zelda: Link's Awakening, the prompt was an 8 year-old's hope for more of The Legend of Zelda, and in subsequent plays the prompt was a pushable despair at knowing the Z:LA wasn't going to be.

Modern games continue to play with this experiencing contract: In <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, for instance, pressing start will in many cases have a dual meaning: I will not be beginning my journey so much as concluding it, and with a character that I have slowly built over the previous two games. And yet, I am starting something...I'm starting the conclusion. The meaning of the contract has slowly evolved.

But let's push appearances deeper now. We might draw a line of distinction between the time of the arcades and the time of the burgeoning home experience: coinage. IN the arcade, the insertion of a coin equaled the beginning of the experience; but on the home consoles, the mark is less physical...nonetheless, it is a contract. We've merely paid up-front.

With the advent of the Press Start, videogames became self-consciously aware of the experience of themselves.
<p style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
But how was the notion pulled out of the world? Or rather, what concept was abstracted in the use of starting?

I mean, in what other way do we encounter starts of such variety? As the only creatures we know of with a recorded history, we are kings of experience. The question then is at what point do we come to new consciousness during an experience? Derrida, in his X, discussed this very thing with the notion of <em>differance</em>: For Derrida, the world is strung together in a series of nodes, with the emphasis being on the string doing the stringing. The meaning of each node is dependent on the previous node, much in the way that language works. The question that Derrida posed is what happens in between those nodes to make the next one more meaningful? And what happens is differance...the meaning generator; a sort of un-seeable, un-feelable pocket that processes the difference between the nodes, or in this case, experiences.

Furthermore, one of the more complicated facets of differance is its paradoxical being...by describing the <em>thing</em> that generates meaning between <em>things</em>, difference is constantly on the run for its own <em>thing-ness</em>.

Our lives occur in a string of moments, strung together by chance. And in between these moments, an untouchable substance of experience, what Derrida calls <em>differance</em>, generating meaning. And yet, how do we, in retrospect, parse these moments for their beginnings? What separates experiences into individual moments of experience?

Press Start is a physical form of the meaning generator. We commit physically and mentally to the starting of a game. Press Start began as a non-experience bridging two different modes of experience; one look at the persistence of Press Start in modern games shows that Press Start has since become an experience in and of itself. The Press Start experience.

We don't always see the Press Start prompt. Passage forgoes it. Minecraft the same. Braid interweaves it into the gameplay experience.

* * *

...Since our Moving Beyond of the golden age of the arcade [the golden age of other-experience], the commodification of experience, we find ourselves standing before a choice, yet with no knowledge of that choice's potential impact. This is the situation we find ourselves in beholding that prompt. We are, to use Robert Penn Warren's words once more, face to face with the margin of mystery where all our calculations collapse, where the stream of time dwindles into the sands of eternity, where the formula fails in the test tube, where chaos and old night hold sway and we hear the laughter in the ether dream. But we don't know we are, and so we just say, Sure.

It's in that way that the bridge becomes a new continent of its own.

Looking back on the early NES ports, there is a feeling of unrest in the game world...The title screens seem like the last vestiges of a bygone era.

These moments become factions, vying for dominance, promising a new substructure, a greater world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, about 15 or so days of free <i>Minecraft</i>, at least.

For those who don't know, the Humble Indie Bundle is a collection of five indie games, all bundled and sold for however much money you are willing to pay. They come with no DRM, work natively on Linux, Mac, and Windows, and you decide who your money goes to. This is the third bundle, but I'm sure you figured that part out already. If not, smack yourself please.

Anyway, along with <i>Crayon Physics Deluxe, Cogs, VVVVVV, Hammerfight,</i>, and <i>And Yet It Moves</i>, you'll get the full version of <i>Minecraft</i> to play until August 14th. If you don't own Minecraft yet, this is probably the best way to see what it's really about without paying much.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Six Things We&#039;d Love to See in Borderlands 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I loved Borderlands like the son I've never had.

Well, I tried to love it.  Unfortunately, like my hypothetical son, Borderlands had some major problems: it wet the bed every other week, it couldn't eat cereal without throwing the bowl against the wall yelling, I am a golden god!, and it was so dreadful at its schoolwork that we had to put him in a special class.

Wait, no, that was the son.  Borderlands had its own set of spectacular problems.  Fortunately, there will be a Borderlands 2, and there will be a chance for Gearbox to fix all the problems that cropped up in the first title!

If only I could reimagine my son, though.  Cletus, get off the bus!


1.Better Online Capabilities

I don't know how the online worked for Borderlands on the consoles, but let me give you the PC gamer's view of Borderlands multiplayer.  The first time I booted up Borderlands, I wanted to play four players with two of my college buddies and one of their friends.  It was Diablo with guns!  It was going to be awesome!

Then we realized it went through Gamespy.

The last game I remember that used Gamespy was Command and Conquer: Generals.  That was a BILLION years ago.  A billion.  Dinosaurs were still alive in movies then.  That first day we managed to play exactly zero minutes of Borderlands together, despite spending three hours figuring it out.  And it never got better.  It.  Never.  Got.  Better.  Well, it got a little better.  I could actually play it now, but I'd have to put up with a ridiculously antiquated multiplayer service to do it, and there would still be major problems.

So, Gearbox, please: if you change one thing, don't use Gamespy.  I know you guys have had tussles with Steam in the past, but use Steamworks.  Or use something else.  Something legitimately stable.  If you release Borderlands again using a decent online multiplayer component, I would pay fifty dollars for it.  Well....


2.More replay value

I've played Diablo 2, conservatively, twenty times.  I could play it another twenty, too.  I've played Torchlight more than I should have, too.

I've played Borderlands once.  I don't know if I could play it again.

Borderlands has a very simple problem in terms of replayability: all the characters are, basically, the same.  They all have guns, and they use those guns to kill 95% of all enemies.  Sure, they each have one additional move.  The Siren can teleport.  The soldier can build defenses.  Et cetera.  But none of these are game changers.  None of the leveling paths feel any different from the others, and none of the powers feels new enough to really, truly, be different in practice.

So when I say Borderlands 2 needs more replay value, this is what I mean: I mean it needs a leveling system.  It needs more individual moves per character, and it needs more class-restricted weapons, so that it feels like I can replay the game and not have the exact same experience.  I want the novelty I'd get if I started playing Diablo 2 as a Druid and started focusing on elemental, a class I've not played for years.  I want each character to feel like a new way to play the game.

Actually, let's build on that point.  There were four classes in Borderlands, and three of them sucked.  No offense to Brick, Roland, or the ridiculously birded Mordecai, but they all offered the same gaming experience.  They found enemies, circle strafed, and shot them a lot.  Sure, Brick could take more hits, Roland had a turret that let him circle strafe differently, and Mordecai could instantly kill anything, but they fought the same.  Only Lilith, the Siren, had variety, in that she could teleport around the field.  She fought differently from everyone else.

Better replay value would come easiest from giving us better character classes to play, and giving them deeper, more interesting ways to interact with the world.  With guns.

3.More incidental story

Something Borderlands doesn't get enough credit for is its story.  Not its big, macguffin filled main plot, but rather its incidental plot.  Patricia Tannis (http://nightmaremode.net/2010/06/character-focus-mays-feature-788/) sums it up perfectly: rather than focus exclusively on narrative, characters like Tannis give the player ways to access the world.  Really, all the secondary characters were good and filled with unexplained personality which served to make us feel like the world of Pandora was alive.

So what I'm asking for is not a change but rather a logical continuation of something that worked in the first game: lots of character in the characters.  Make sure the quest givers have names and faces we remember like Ms. Tannis.  I feel like Gearbox know how to create quality characters who can be humorous without being caricatures, but then I remember Duke Nukem Forever*.

On the plus side, between when this article was written and this article was published, the (http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/06/first-fragments-of-borderlands-2-revealed/) dreaded Game Informer drip feed of news has revealed that yes, Borderlands will have more dynamic NPCs.  Will they be the Patricia Tannis type or the kooky but ultimately empty type, though?  That's the more meaningful question.

4.More Guns, Better Guns

Borderlands had a lot of guns.  That was its schtick.  The problem was, most of those guns were useless to the point where they could never be anything but vendor fodder.

What I'm looking for is twofold.  First, I loved the imagined competition between various factions of gun makers, who competed for your hard earned money.  I'd love for each gun maker to be ever more distinct, so that the choices you made in terms of firearms mattered even more than it did.

Second, I want better guns.  Borderlands had a complicated random generation system that served to give us a decent variety of firearms experiences, but the true problem was the variety of base guns.  If there was ever a game that could have taken a page from Ratchet and Clank and made a ton of really weird gun templates that could work in its wacky universe, it was Borderlands.  Instead, we got very basic guns that occasionally shot fire or rockets.  Which was nice, but we could have had so many more ludicrous guns.  We could have had mine shotguns.  We could have fired big horrible tornadoes.  Flamethrowers.  Ice throwers.  Rockets that produced angry, malicious ferrets.  There were so many possibilities, and all we got were the occasional rocket gun.

We need more, in short.  More crazy guns.

5.Less Busywork

These last two points compile my major complaint about Borderlands: too much of it felt procedural and not in a good way.   Good procedural generation keeps things fresh by preventing you from memorizing the layouts of places.  Diablo 2 did this.  Borderlands made you feel like you were doing generic quests too often for the money and experience in a stagnant world.  While the gunplay ended up high quality, it felt like most of the quests were pretty mediocre.  Sure, there were stunners in there, but most of the time I felt like I was doing a quest that had been slapped together in a spreadsheet without a lot of thought.

So give us more thoughtful quests.  Make sure we remember the things we do in the game, not just for the quality of the character giving the quest to us but because the quest itself is interesting and fresh.  Keep the plot tight, and keep the sidequests tight.  Make more of them like the Tannis quest line, where we were doing something that contributed to the story of the world as well as providing us with a narrative.  Give us reasons to do things besides money we'd never spend on anything.

Ham-fisted into this point will be bosses, because the bosses in Borderlands often felt like busywork, especially in single player.  Most of them sucked.  Really sucked.  They were enemies with tons of health that you were forced to circle strafe around or, in the case of the obnoxious vehicle boss at the end of act two, they were enemies you had to flail around at and hope you did enough damage before they brutally murdered you.  They sucked, and I'd love to see them improve.

6.Better navigation

One thing I completely forgot about about Borderlands before being reminded by my many and valued fellow writers was how absolutely terrible the navigation was in Borderlands.  The lack of minimap was criminal.  The mapping itself, which gave you big blue shapes and said, Do something with this! was about as bad.  Really, for a game where you had to go lots of places, Borderlands managed to make it as hard as possible to travel around.

The inclusion of a mini map would clutter the HUD a little bit, but it would keep us from having to pause every minute to see where we're going, something that completely breaks the flow of the game.  It's a simple solution to a very simple problem, but it's something that would make Borderlands a hell of a lot more fun to play.

I have to admit, as someone pretty staunchly anti-sequel, I'm excited for another Borderlands.  It's the kind of game I want there to be more of: Borderlands is an interesting genre combination, and it was a game where major improvements could be pretty easily made.  So I'm excited to see where they go with it, and what kinds of changes they could offer.  Hopefully the new game fulfills the promise of the old.

*Okay, Gearbox partisans, don't close that browser immediately.  Don't!  Down boy!  Gearbox have made some really good games over the years, and I know they're not 100% responsible for Duke Nukem Forever.  They're, at most, 20% responsible for the first tripe A game this generation not to be able to pay enough money to get reviews above 80.  But they're the ones who put their names on the box.  They said, This is funny, and this is vital, and we will release this!  Okay, maybe they said, This will make us a carton of money! and released it for that.  A good artist realizes that the work he created was utter shit and drowns it in the river, because if he releases it will destroy his reputation.  That's Duke Nukem Forever to Gearbox, but with another degree of separation.  We know they didn't make all the mistakes in the game, but they said those mistakes were worth playing.  And for that we can make fun of them.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Alternet lists video games as reason &quot;young American&#039;s don&#039;t fight back&quot;.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a recent Bruce Levine article at alternet.org, television and subsequently video games made his list of 8 reasons young Americans don't fight back.  Fight back against who?  I assume "the system".  Once this was pointed out to me, I had to pull myself away from studying my favorite Levine - Ken - to listen to what Bruce had to say and formulate a response.  In said article, Mr. Bruce Levine, a clinical psychologist and author, stated the following:
<blockquote>TV viewers' brainwaves slow down, transforming them closer to a hypnotic  state that makes it difficult to think critically. While playing a  video games [sic] is not as zombifying as passively viewing TV, such games  have become for many boys and young men their only experience of  potency, and this virtual potency is certainly no threat to the ruling  elite.</blockquote>
It should be noted that his article was not attempting to single out video games specifically.  They were merely listed under the "television" section of his list.  10 - 15 years ago, a statement such as this would have set me off on a rant that would have made Dennis Miller proud.  It also would have been 10 - 15 years ago, so a Dennis Miller reference would have still been relevant.

However, I've fought this fight.  I've fought the "games are art" fight.  I've fought the "games caused Columbine" fight.  I've fought the "Hot Coffee mod" fight.  I've fought the Schwarzenegger v. EMA fight.  Hell, I've even fought a Fox News "alien sex scene in Mass Effect" fight.  It's a lot of fighting for an American gamer that isn't supposed to want to fight back.  But I've grown out of getting angry over these things and merely want to express why this opinion is wrong.

The author seems to think that America's youth has not responded to various social situations.  Is this because we have not launched into riots like the youth in London?  Or staged a regime change like the youth in Egypt?  Does not each individual situation deserve an individual and appropriate response?  I argue that America's youth has responded in various ways.

In 2004, New York City witnessed one of the largest protests in American history during the week of the Republican National Convention to be held at Madison Square Garden.  Protests were due to a number of concerns, but the Iraq war was undoubtedly the hot-button topic.  No official numbers could be gathered, but in 2007, NYPD deputy chief of police Paul Browne stated that on August 29th alone, easily 800,000 people were involved in the protest.

In October 2010, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert hosted the "Rally to  Restore Sanity and/or Keep Fear Alive" in an effort to show that  Americans would rather collaborate to fix problems rather than bicker  about partisan politics.  The rally drew an estimated 215,000  participants.

But while I could go on and on listing instance after instance of protests and activism, there is no greater example than the 2008 Presidential election.  In January 2008, Time Magazine hailed the youth vote as the key to Obama's Iowa primary win.  Alternet itself published an article entitled "Ignore the Youth Vote at Your Own Peril" in May of 2008 during the run-up to the election.  Various exit polls showed that young voters preferred Obama to McCain in a nearly 7 to 3 margin and John Della Volpe, director of polling for the Harvard University Institute of Politics, stated that the youth vote turned many states that would have been losses or slight wins for Obama into a win by a comfortable margin.  Was this not a youth response?

So you have a protest with 800,000 participants, a rally with 215,000 participants, and a youth vote credited with the election of the first black President in American history.  Were the 18 - 29 year olds that participated not gamers?  Do we not receive any credit for our part in these and other activist endeavors?

But I will not pretend as though apathy does not exist.  Of course not.  I embrace the apathy.  Apathy is yet another response from America's youth, and as a member of said gaming youth (I'm 29...I still count for now!) I can give Mr. Levine his reason.  It's not television or gaming or any of the reasons he listed, although some may contribute here and there.  If he wants to find the main reason, he needs look no further than his own Alternet article.  This is the claim Alternet makes about their mission statement:
<blockquote>Alternet has developed a unique model of journalism to confront the failures of corporate media, as well as the vitriol and disinformation of right wing media, especially hate talk media.</blockquote>
And below you will find the text of two ads that as of this writing, were running on the site on the very article Mr. Levine wrote:
<blockquote>Oh yes, you can!  21 ways to frustrate Obama's army of snoops, busybodies and asset grabbing bureaucrats.Voter suppression in Florida.  FL republicans robbed Al Gore.  Now they're planning to steal the presidency again.  Stop them today.</blockquote>
So there you have it.  Even the website that claims to confront the failures of corporate media, the very website that Mr. Levine used to write about youthful Americans succumbing to their corporate overlords, is willing to whore itself out to either party's fear-mongering as long as it gets them a buck.  Our congress showed that our credit standing is nothing more than a bargaining chip to be tossed about with hopes of gaining the upper hand on your political opponent.

We are the youth of America, Mr. Levine.  We are the gamers.  We have fought in the past whether it be for AIDS funding, political protests for either party or by showing up and voting at the polls.  So you say the youth of America needs to fight back?  Simply give us something worth fighting for and give us a voice and we will gladly take up our plasma swords and portal guns and hit the streets.  However, now we are left choosing between Superman 64 and Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis.  Perhaps it's a fight that we've chosen to sit out.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Deus Ex: Human Revolution&#039;s Boss Fights Were Outsourced</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/?p=10988</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, that explains why the boss fights felt so different from the rest of the game. For those who haven't played/don't know, Human Revolution is a game that lets you play however you want. It does this pretty admirably, but the boss fights force you into fighting, no matter what your style-of-play or character build is. This has led to quite a few people understandable not liking them, and criticizing the fights for being so out of place, forcing you into one playstyle(shooting them dead), and for being generally uninspired. Criticizing was also given to the bosses for being so under-characterized(hell, I can't even remember two of the three bosses names). They are rarely referred to, and we are given nothing about who they are, why they're doing what they're doing, their past, or anything about them, really.

In a game where you can investigate damn near everyone and learn everything about them, this felt very... lets just say "odd". And now we know why. The studio behind the boss fights is G.R.I.P., and here's a nice little video of the CEO talking about working on the boss fights:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9YbSkOW7sU

Interesting note; he says he's a "shooter guy", and didn't know that much about Deus Ex in general. Guess that explains why there was no solution other that "shooting" for the bosses.

<p style="text-align: justify"><em> </em><em>Journey's</em> faceless protagonist will be many things—a hero returning home; a queen in exile; a poet passing into death—all inventions of the individual player. And yet, in our endeavors across this alien desert, this mellifluous proof of the violence of time, we will find ourselves a part of a much greater role: we will be the sense-makers of language's great ruin.</p>

<div><a rel="attachment wp-att-6951" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/unspoken-word-communication-and-journey-6711/journey-game-screenshot-6/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6951" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/journey-game-screenshot-6.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="323" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify">In the coded epitaphs of a desert cemetery; in the white goddess's ideogramic narratives; even in the size and shape of each cove that conceals within it this once-civilization...we will find the detritus of language. What happened to it? Where did it go? And from what threat did it flee? The world of <em>Journey</em> exists in the remnants of communication. Venturing beyond the silent deserts we cross as if into a peristylium—each canyon houses within it a garden of History; each footfall is a Great Listening. And yet our listening alone will not repair this world: the language that failed it will fail us too. <em>Journey</em> asks us to build something stronger.</div>
<div style="text-align: center">* * *</div>
<div style="text-align: left"><a rel="attachment wp-att-6889" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/unspoken-word-communication-and-journey-6711/journey-game-screenshot-10/"><img class="size-full wp-image-6889 alignleft" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/journey-game-screenshot-10.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="206" /></a></div>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">It was here, upon the mons pubis of the unknown world...our first encounter. I approached her but she fled, flitting across      the sands and out of view. In subsequent encounters she would be just as clever, just as cruel.<span style="color: #333333"> Another time </span>I left myself at the summit of a great peak, going on about my life elsewhere. When I returned I found that I had fallen from my perch, that I was now kneeling in the sand. Had she  visited? Had I fallen to my knees out of  passion or regret?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span>Incapable of expressing ourselves through spoken language,  she and I revert  back to sheer physicality.  We stand face to face. We mimic the rhythms of each others melodies. We thread  ourselves up and over  and  under each other, crossing silently through the wind-struck desert. Our trajectories, once separate, now merge.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span>One time she and I were separated while exploring opposite ends of a canyon. Unable to find her, I climbed to the highest place I could and stood chirping, like a Mourning Dove.<span style="color: #ffffff"> </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span>I've tried stopping her from leaving me but the idea never transmits. I push at her and she slips fluidly past. I sing and sound only beautiful and mesmerizing. No matter what I do she leaves me forever again. What is it, I wonder, that I expect to change? Perhaps she knows exactly what she's doing.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center">***</div>
<div>Of course, "her" has no meaning in <em>Journey</em>. Any person I might run across in the desert will be identical to me, both in physical ability and appearance. Like the role I invent for the protagonist, this designation of gender has no more meaning than what I attribute to it. And yet I attribute a lot to it, and I wonder why. Maybe it's the suggestive shape of our mutual destination, vaguely phallo-vaginal and looming everpresent. Perhaps the nature of one's companion is simply dependent on the category of one's loneliness. Maybe it's something deeper than that.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span></div>
<div>It's probably unhealthy to have a crush on a videogame character. But I know there's a heartbeat to her somewhere, that her movements across the sand are inherently human. And, yes, I realize that there's always someone else playing her each time we meet...In the meeting place of <em>Journey</em> and my denial, "other people" is only a change in mood. Whoever she may be she becomes her.</div>
<div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span></div>
</div>
<div>Because the outside world is not unlike the inside. In our world, too, the history of language is in gesture, in the physical nuance turned meaningful. Without words to speak we will speak something other than words.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span></div>
<div>The first time she and I parted I mourned the loss of my companion. At the time, I couldn't help but feel that this game—whenever it may finally release—would be one about coming to care for someone only to see them inevitably vanish forever.</div>
<div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff">***</span></div>
</div>
<div>But now I'm beginning to understand the world of the game. She'll be no more gone than I am. When I return she'll be here—somewhere, someone.</div>]]></content:encoded>

The wait is over! The good folks at Bethesda have posted the Fan Interview on the official Bethesda Forums. Many of us here at Nightmare Mode are drooling of some of the juicy bits that have been revealed in this interview.

One of the more interesting pieces involve changes to Enchanting and making it a character skill that can be improved.  And instead of learning spells and enchanting with that, you will be breaking down magical equipment for their spells and transferring the enchantment.

You can now forge your own weapons and armor. The quality will depend on the ingredients used and your skill level. You can also improve your equipment at a forge. And the graphics for armor and weapons have been revamped as well

Dragon shouts will be available to all classes and there will most likely be specific one geared towards certain play styles. Like stealthy or long range characters will have access to shouts that will help them in that style of gameplay. But the people at Bethesda weren't ready to fully comment on it.

Not everything though has to deal with equipment and spells. Take for example you can get married in Skyrim and move into a house together. Or that the PC version will have higher res textures, larger render modes, and a bunch of other effects you can scale up if your machine is a beast as well as the creation kit that TES fans have come to know and love. And a totally redone facial system if that wasn't enough.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm one who hardly ever posts news posts.  I'm too busy to scour the net for exclusives, and I'm not paid nearly well enough (at all!) to care about reporting on new things.  Besides, it's not like we have any new things to ever report on.

<a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/07/august-cover-revealed-dishonored.aspx">Or do we?</a>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dishonored-cover.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dishonored-cover-1024x606.jpg" alt="" title="dishonored-cover" width="512" height="303" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7242" /></a>

Apparently, the next issue of Game Informer will feature exclusive information (those bastards!) about a new Bethesda project from Arkane (developers of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic) teamed up with Harvey Smith of Deus Ex fame and Viktor Antonov, who did graphic design work on Half Life 2.

Here's with what Game Informer titillates us:



<blockquote>
It's a game about assassination where you don't have to kill anyone. It's a game about infiltration where you can set up traps and slaughter the entire garrison of an aristocrat's mansion rather than sneak in. It's a game about brutal violence where you can slip in and out of a fortified barracks with nobody ever knowing you were there. It's a game about morality and player choice where the world you create is based on your actions, not navigating conversation trees.</blockquote>



Which sounds a lot like Deus Ex, and a lot like a game I want to play right now.

And frankly, we live in a world where there aren't that many new games.  I mean, even this is basically a modern day attempt at Deus Ex, but let's not get pissy.  This is a brand new IP, and I have to applaud Bethesda for being one of the few publishers who seems willing to take on new projects instead of just reiterating over and over (for the record, I'll give some points to EA (reluctantly), THQ, and Sony for doing the same).  Even if I wasn't rabidly interested in this game, which I am, I'd have to applaud Bethesda for releasing more new IPS at retail in the past year so far than every major publisher combined.

Furthermore, let's applaud them again for taking a chance on Arkane, who've made some really neat games in the past (Arx Fatalis was a favorite of mine years ago, and I've heard people say good things about Dark Messiah of Might and Magic to me) that have been doomed to obscurity by lack of support.  It's good on Bethesda for giving people like them and Obsidian chance to ply their craft in new and inventive ways, because they make vital games.

So the basic gist of this post is good on Bethesda.  In an industry devoid of good guys, where publishers consistently fail us by removing modding tools or getting rid of player hosted servers or dumbing down their games to get more console sales, it's lovely to see a company so dedicated to gaming, and hardcore gaming, in general.  It almost makes me want to go out and buy Hunted in a show of solidarity.

The second gist of this newspost is that Dishonored is the next big thing.  Yeah, there's a little bit of a getting on the Deus Ex train as Deus Ex: Human Revolutions spirals into our lives, but let me be perfectly frank: this is a type of game that hasn't been made for years.  There aren't enough games where you have the freedom to go about situations in different ways (no, flamethrower or shotgun doesn't count as a choice), and I'm glad the genre is making a comeback.

It's games like this, announcements like this, that make me glad to be playing games.  ]]></content:encoded>

Recently I had the pleasure of sitting down with the great Chris Avellone himself, one of the minds behind the critically acclaimed Fallout franchise and Planescape: Torment. What follows is our exchange, where we speak of nearly everything you can think of in association to the RPG genre, Fallout and more. Enjoy!

<strong>Could you tell our readers about yourself--who you are and what you do?</strong>

I'm Chris Avellone, Creative Director at Obsidian Entertainment and Project Director on most of the Fallout New Vegas DLCs: Dead Money, Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road. Creative Director means I oversee all the projects from a design perspective, play the builds of all our games (over and over and over - which is a good thing), oversee the design department, attend level and design reviews of our titles, test and interview new applicants, and work with the designers to establish company-wide standards for all our projects.

<strong>What are your top three favorite games and why? What games are you playing at the moment?</strong>

It's hard to give the top 3 - my top choices are Fallout 1 (dialogue mechanics and branching quest solutions), System Shock 2 (everything, this is like a game design textbook), and Chronotrigger (narrative mechanics and branching story possibilities, great story).

In terms of what I'm playing right now/recently played: Portal 2, Amnesia: The Dark Descent (best $20 I've spent, that game scared the hell out of me - if you haven't checked it out, I highly recommend it), Puzzle Quest 2, League of Legends, and I'm playing the Fallout New Vegas DLCs (Right now, Lonesome Road) and Dungeon Siege III repeatedly at work. If I have free time, it goes to playing the company's builds to try and polish as much as possible before release. I may sneak in Dungeon Raid for brief intervals when I can.

<strong>What's it like working on primarily RPG projects in a day and age when the genre seems to be going through so much change? How do you feel about many of the changes/evolutions we are seeing in the genre?</strong>

It's pretty exciting, and the technology and resources now being diverted to gaming is making the experience far more than I thought it could be (voice acting, motion sensors, voice recognition). I suppose it's still a far cry from the Star Trek holodeck or jacking into virtual space, but it's getting there.

<strong>Recently there has been a lot of commotion over Matt Findley's (Hunted: The Demon's  Forge--and also hailing from Interplay) comments regarding older fantasy games--typically RPGs--"always wanted to be action games at their heart." Do you agree with that statement? Would you, as someone who also worked at Interplay, say that some of the games you've worked on in the past actually wanted to be action games at heart?</strong>

I think Stonekeep definitely wanted to be an action RPG (Ultima Underworld was out around that time). I don't think Baldur's Gate could have been and still been Baldur's Gate (or at least had as many party members), same with Torment and Icewind Dale. That said, however, at points in development at Interplay there were action RPG versions of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape (not Torment, but an action title like King's Field in the same universe) all in the works, although only the ARPG BG title came out (Dark Alliance).

<strong>Do you think choices work when they are put into games that are not fundamentally about choosing the outcome of the story?</strong>

As long as the choice is still meaningful in some fashion, either in a game mechanic context or if it causes a change in the immediate area you're in. Also, can depend on the genre -- some genres of games have seen so little of it (what, I can tackle the objectives in any order?), that even a single choice like that can cause a huge reaction, even if it's giving the player a minor option. This was the basis of a Splinter Cell lecture at GDC many years past - I can't dig up the exact lecture from GDC, otherwise I'd cite case and context, but a choice presented in the game, while it technically led to the same result, was such a new element for that game genre, that people really latched on to it.

<strong>The dialogue wheel vs. traditional lines of text. Do you think choosing one or the other for an RPG has significant consequences? Does the former make role-playing easier since you are choosing based on a general principle, or harder since you don't know exactly what you are choosing to say?</strong>

I prefer choosing text lines because I want to know exactly what I am going to say, not the "gist" of what I'm going to say and then passively watching to see what I say. This may sound strange coming from the narrative designer of the title, but I didn't like the emotion adjectives in Alpha Protocol, even though there were parts of that system that I thought were great.

Also, I don't usually care for games that give my character a voice - that's my only comment. I think it works sometimes (Mass Effect), other times I feel it ends up being extraneous and a waste of time... although it all depends what type of "role-playing" you're doing. If you're role-playing a specific character (which may sound strange in the context of "role-playing"), then voice is fine and great. If you're allowed to build and customize your character, I prefer no voice.

Then again, my approach with that may be Old School, so take that with a grain of salt.

<strong>Let's talk Fallout for a second. Could you tell us what your favorite/most satisfying story or dialogue options in a Fallout game are?</strong>

In Fallout 1, the end options with the Master using speech and the evidence you found was an epic moment, I've seen it rarely topped or seen any other conversation come close.

In Fallout 2, hard to say. I did enjoy out-smarting Myron with a high Science character, and confronting Cassidy on his tribal prejudice in Vault City... and if you get in good with Lysette, you can force the
Vault City Captain of the Guard to give Cassidy his bar back.

In Fallout 3, I thought Ashur from the Pitt DLC was an interesting character with an interesting philosophy (or work ethic you could say), and the whole set-up of the Pitt (forcing you to immerse yourself in their culture) was great in building him up. That was a conscious decision they made in the design documentation that I read, and I thought it worked really well.

In Fallout New Vegas, I enjoyed speaking to No-Bark and Vulpes, using Barter with the Legate and Oliver (I always felt Barter was under-used), and telling Oliver that you'll rocketfuck his whole battalion with your Securitron army. That, and thanks to Charlie Staples, our Lead Level Designer, for setting up the scene where you ask the Securitron to throw Oliver's body off Hoover Dam.

<strong>Van Buren was a project that was originally meant to be Fallout 3. Though that project never came to be, we're now seeing elements of that project resurface in Fallout New Vegas. How did you guys go about deciding which elements would be necro'd? How did it feel to have the opportunity to make parts of that project actually happen?</strong>

We just picked and chose what elements still seemed to work and we were interested in resurrecting. Wasn't a formal process, but it was gratifying to see some of those older bits come back to life (FNV DLC3: Old World Blues, especially - I always wanted to see the Big Empty come to life in a computer game).

<strong>As far as the public knows, New Vegas marks the end of your involvement with the Fallout franchise in the near future. How do you feel about that?</strong>

Sad, but hey, it's happened to me before with Fallout at Black Isle, and this time, it goes out with a bang in Lonesome Road... if you want. It's nice to be able to put down the punctuation mark at the end.

<strong>Feargus Urquhart says that 10 years ago, you didn't want to contemplate the idea of Torment 2. Let's open that can of worms: do you still feel that way? Could you see yourself revisiting the game--or for that matter, any of your older projects?</strong>

Torment 2, no, Planescape 2, yes. I'd always work on Fallout, and Icewind Dale was always fun because no one took it too seriously and even the campaign setting was a little more relaxed than the rest of the Forgotten Realms. Icewind Dale 2, especially, I thought was totally nuts in terms of flow and level design, but the designers at Black Isle had fun making it... we took that principle into Fallout New Vegas: Old World Blues to see what people would come up with, and in my opinion, it worked. There's plenty of variety in the locations for folks to check out and explore.

<strong>Recently you made comments regarding power fantasies in an interview, as well as the importance of choice and consequence. How can the two be balanced out?</strong>

They don't need to be balanced, they're one in the same - the fact that your choices are having repercussions on a global/nation/faction-scale is a power fantasy in itself.

<strong>Creating a world that seems alive and reacts to your influence is a very difficult task. What lessons or techniques have you learned from your days writing Campaigns for Dungeons and Dragons?</strong>

It doesn't have to be a big event is the key - it just needs to be clear, specific, and simple. In Fallout 1, even having a single guard react to you choosing Killian over Gizmo in Junktown is enough to make the world seem alive, and that's just two barkstrings to remind you the world is paying attention. I think the more you can do to tie it into a game mechanic system (like the Reputation mechanics and faction repercussions in Fallout New Vegas), that's even better for making the world react to your actions.

<strong>Is there anything you feel that games are lacking or do poorly that Pen and Paper/ tabletop gaming do particularly well, or elements from Pen and Paper that you'd like to see more of in video games?</strong>

I'd like more immediate player feedback. ME2's metric report was a good take on it (those kind of metrics are invaluable to game developers), and Twitter, helps too, oddly enough.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anyone who's ever cared about Japanese games featuring effeminate men with ludicrously oversized swords has been following the saga of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Story">The Last Story</a>.  Nintendo has had an on-again, off-again affair with localizing these two titles from prominent studios Monolith Soft and Mistwalker, going so far as to announce the former in America at E3 2008.  Fan support has been pretty immense, with <a href="http://oprainfall.blogspot.com/">Operation Rainfall</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/OpRainfall">having collected a couple thousand twitter followers in a short span</a>, <a href="http://oprainfall.blogspot.com/2011/06/xenoblade.html">organizing a letter writing campaign</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monado-Beginning-World-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B002IM1MYG/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1310156577&sr=1-1">pushing Xenoblade's pre-order into the top ten sales on Amazon</a>.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Xenoblade_header.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Xenoblade_header-300x144.jpg" alt="" title="Xenoblade_header" width="600" height="288" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7290" /></a>

With all this attention, Nintendo has seen fit to respond, and while they'll never say never, they aren't going to bring it over.  Operation Rainfall still plans to go ahead with their letter writing campaign, which I encourage all of you to participate in, but it's still dark days.

They say it's always darkest before the dawn, but I don't know if it's the case this time.

Nintendo has a laundry list of reasons why they don't want to release these games in the United States.  Translation is costly, and they need all their translators to accommodate the many and varied 3DS games they have coming out.  They'd need to hire voice actors, and unlike a company like Atlus they don't have a stable of voice actors they keep in contact with (since, you know, so few of their characters talk).  They don't want to publish any games that won't move millions of units, because that's how you make a profit in this business anymore: you sell millions of games.

Of course, none of these reasons particularly matter when you look at the Wii and see a console in its death throes.  No games have been released for seven months now.  There are two games on the horizon, Skyward Sword and a new Kirby game, but it's bleak after that.  The WiiU won't launch for a year at least, and the 3DS is equally dead and dilapidated, with its only game being a port of a decade old title.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-Last-Story_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-Last-Story_1.jpg" alt="" title="The Last Story_1" width="631" height="354" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7291" /></a>

If we look at the Wii sales on Amazon, we see a console that has 6 games in top ten of sales that are dance games.  Three others are old Mario titles that are still hanging around despite being years old.

The other game is Monado: Beginning of the World, which is the original name of Xenoblade.  This isn't a game no one would buy: it wouldn't sell a million copies, to be sure, but something has to be said for ameliorating your hardcore fan base when a new console's coming out.

Because that's the real trick: hardcore gamers are the early adopters of new consoles.  If the core is enthused, and your product is good enough, you can have a situation like the Wii, which is what made Nintendo all the money they've lost over the past couple years.  The Wii succeeded because hardcore gamers bought into the pure potential of motion control while the casual gamer bought into the cool new device that did something entirely different from other consoles.  This two pronged approach is the way to sell consoles, and Nintendo, without a truly novel new device to shop, is in danger of missing on both fronts.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Xenoblade_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Xenoblade_1.jpg" alt="" title="Xenoblade_1" width="631" height="354" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7292" /></a>

You get the impression from this that maybe there's an increasing plurality of Nintendo shareholders who are like the one who declared <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-shareholder-hates-games-says-stupid-things-204999.phtml">games are a waste of time.</a>   The only game he seemed to know Nintendo made was Wii Fit, and that seems to be the company line these days: they make Wii Fit and titles that cater to the nostalgia market that will sell a million copies based off of brand recognition alone.  No need to care about gamers, because it's not like gamers are what made those games household names in the first place or anything.

No one is saying, financially, that The Last Story and Xenoblade wouldn't be risks*.  What we're saying is that they're good investments.  Nintendo can say, as a company, that they're behind the core gamer as much as they like (and it's been the mantra of the past two E3's), but it takes games to convince us that they're sticking to their words, and these two titles would be all the convincing we need to realize Nintendo isn't completely out of touch.

Because that's where they seem to be right now: out of touch.  Sony and Microsoft, for all their faults, wouldn't waste a second on two highly rated Japanese imports.  They'd probably try to make them day and date in America, not necessarily even for the money but for the prestige.  One thing we cannot say about Nintendo's two competitors is that they do not try to court fan favor.  They want to make money, but they also realize that happy fans buy more games.  They buy more new games.  They get more excited about major games because they feel like they're not just living by the whims of some out-of-touch corporate giant who might doom their favorite game to obscurity.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Xenoblade_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Xenoblade_2.jpg" alt="" title="Xenoblade_2" width="631" height="354" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7293" /></a>

That's where Nintendo is right now: fans don't feel like they can trust them to make the best decisions about games they want.  I know I don't trust Nintendo to do anything even remotely good for me, and this mistrust has led me into the arms of other waiting platforms, who promise me everything's going to be okay.  They're not going to do the things Nintendo does.

They seem to care, and Nintendo doesn't.  They care about money, but they don't even seem to know how to go about that, considering they've gone from in-control titan to losing money hand over fist in the span of a couple years.

Personally, I encourage all of you to write letters with Operation Rainfall's campaign, tomorrow if you are on the east coast or later if you are on the west.  We need to tell Nintendo how they can help themselves and how they can win us back.  Otherwise, I'm afraid they'll wander about in the dark forever, looking for firewood inside their wooden house.

*You will notice me leaving out the other games that have leapfrogged onto this bandwagon, most notably Pandora's Tower.  I'll be honest, and I'll take Nintendo's side: Pandora's Tower is a bad risk because it doesn't have the name value to move even a hundred thousand.  Sorry, fans, but I get the impression no one's all that amped up for it.  Which is a shame, I freely admit.  I'd buy it on launch.  But it would not be a practical risk for Nintendo.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<div>The Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta is out, and it runs from July 2nd(or June 28th for lucky early-access people) to July 14th. While it's not the final product, it's shaping up to be a pretty good online experience. Like the first two, it blends third-person cover-based shooting with heavy platforming elements. And like the first two, it makes moving around maps and getting the jump on enemies just a complete joy. The game also breaks free from the monotony of cover-based shooting, since you're moving around a lot more thanks to the level design.&nbsp;

Featured in the beta are two maps and five game-modes. The maps, Chateau and Airstrip, are well built, visually distinct, and fun to play on. Chateau is centered around a destroyed mansion in the middle of the Jungle, and provides plenty of opportunities to get around enemies. Airstrip is the more interesting map of the two. It starts with one team(hero's) on a plane, and the other(villains) in trucks trying to board said plane. It keeps the action moving and interesting, and it's one hell of a fun time. Sadly it's just a short part of the overall map, and after about 3 minutes or so the plane takes off and you head into a normal, static multiplayer map.

The gameplay is still solid though, and the maps are big and complex enough that it's doubtful that you'll be staying in one place for long. And though some interesting map-related things do happen, like the middle of the mansion in Chateau caving in and the occasional fighter-plane dive-bomb on Airstrip, they're just not as fun as truck-hopping to a plane. The five game-modes are your standard multiplayer fare. Team Deathmatch, Team Objective, Plunder, which is essentially capture the flag, hardcore, which is Team Deathmatch but without gameplay modifiers, and co-op where three humans have to fight off waves of enemies while completing objectives. Throughout these game modes, or most of them at least, when a team is losing pretty badly a power play will kick in. Power plays give a slight advantage to the losing team. So far I've only seen 3, attack the target, which basically marks a player as a special target that gives more points when killed. Exposed, which exposes the winning team. And double damage, which... is pretty self explanatory. It all does a decent job of giving the losing team a chance at catching up, and keeps the winning team on their toes. Along with all this, we can see that character customization has been expanded upon.

Well, kind of. In the beta the offerings are pretty limited, but if you use your <span style="color: #ff0000">I</span><span style="color: #0000ff">m</span><span style="color: #008000">a</span><span style="color: #333399">g</span><span style="color: #ffff00">i</span><span style="color: #00ffff">n</span><span style="color: #ff9900">a</span><span style="color: #ff00ff">t</span><span style="color: #ff0000">i</span><span style="color: #0000ff">o</span><span style="color: #008000">n</span><span style="color: #339966">!</span>, you can imagine more stuff to unlock. I'm sure the full game will have more things. Hopefully. Anyway, you have 4 characters to choose from, 3 on heroes and 1 on villains. For heroes you can choose between the main characters of the story, Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan, or some guy named Treasure Hunter, kind of odd name for a person but whatever. The offerings to change Drake and Sully are very limited, but Treasure Hunter gets a bit more clothes to choose from. On the villains side you have Pirate, which is again an odd name for an adult, but I digress. Pirate gets a lot more stuff to choose from than any of the heroes, which is kind of neat, though almost all you have to unlock, so that's lame. You unlock clothes by collecting random treasures that randomly pop up when you randomly kill people. Yeah, it's as annoying as you think. Unless you like all that randomness, in which case you'll love it, I guess. Hopefully in the final game unlocking stuff will require more specific specifications, but as it stands now, it's annoying. Apart from playing dress-up without much clothing options (or dresses for that matter... Naughty Dog, get on that!), you can also choose an emblem for yourself. Nothing too special here, but one neat thing is that if your doing well in a match, your emblem starts appearing all over the map your on. Yeah it's a small feature, but I love stuff like this. It's a nice ego boost to see your emblem appear all over the place.

Uncharted 3 also introduces loadouts. Nothing you haven't seen here. You pick what weapons and boosters(think perks) to spawn with. Nothing too special, and the perks don't really do much to drastically change the gameplay. Which is good thing. You can also choose a kickback, which is essentially a killstreak. Get a certain amount of medals, and press up on the D-pad to activate it. These can be as simple as spawning a rocket launcher or causing you grenades to split into more grenades, or more fantastical like kicking up a smoke-screen and teleporting away, or turning into a swarm of spiders. Or that's what it says, at least. It isn't available to players in the beta, instead it sits there. Mocking us, mocking <em>me</em>.

[caption id="attachment_7277" align="aligncenter" width="498" caption="Ah... if only..."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Uncharted3Spiders.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7277  " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Uncharted3Spiders.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="217" /></a>[/caption]

Anyway, another feature in the beta is a cinema mode. This little tool lets you watch past games. With it, you can record clips and take screenshots. Or you could, if it wasn't broken. You can still view games and stuff, but don't expect to record video or take screenshots. From what I see, screenshots aren't supported in the beta, unless I missed something, in which case sorry for being stupid, and when you record a video clip and try to edit it, the game turns all of the visual effects to their lowest points which results in a pitch black screen. So yeah, that's cinema mode at the moment.

All in all, the beta is more or less a slightly improved version of Uncharted 2's multi-player. The cover-based combat with strong platforming elements are still there, which is nice and helps to keep the game from falling too far into boring territory. The gameplay modifiers, boosters, kickbacks, and power-plays help keep games interesting. The maps are well designed and fun to play on and look at. Overall, and despite my sarcastic remarks, it's shaping up to be a good experience. Though despite great platforming, it still tends to devolve into your standard TPS cover-based gameplay every now and then. You know, sit in cover, shoot other person's head, repeat. Hopefully more maps are like the first part of Airstrip, since that would definitely make things a lot more interesting than they already are and show what the game can really do.

Still, the beta lasts until July 14th, so if you have a PS3 and want to check it out, go for it. I'd say it's definitally worth the time.

		<title>Ken Levine wants developers in the media spotlight</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Bioshock</em> creator Ken Levine's been doing the media rounds promoting G4TV's airing of the E3 <a title="Bioshock Infinite demo" href="http://www.gametrailers.com/episode/gametrailers-tv/124" target="_blank"><em>Bioshock Infinite</em> demo</a>, and appeared on the <a title="Gamers With Jobs podcast" href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/podcast" target="_blank">Gamers With Jobs podcast</a> to discuss the video, E3 and the difficulty in promoting a game in mainstream media.

Levine cited an appearance at a state school where an entire classroom had never heard of <em>Bioshock</em>, let alone played it as exemplary of the lack of exposure games have in the mainstream, but thanks to advertising ubiquity and a huge marketing budget, everyone knows more than they'd want to know about the latest <em>Transformers. </em>Video games don't have the same kind of outlets in which they can be promoted.

"When you have a big game coming, I think there's this weird sense that there's certain places you can promote the game and certain ways you can show it, so you do it at E3 and you have people write articles about it.

"We need to be on mainstream shows. We need to be on NPR. We need to be on <em>Fresh Air</em>. We need to be in those places talking about what we do ... we're still kind of ghettoized as game developers, and we need to think about, how do we reach out and talk to people, so you don't have a room full of college kids saying 'I've never heard of that game.'"

Games certainly have mainstream advertising presence, as Levine acknowledges - most major news outlets do reviews, and there are TV spots and bus ads. But why is it so hard to give a game the same cultural ubiquity afforded to TV, books and film?

I think it comes down to face value and authorship. For one, the acting in games is either voice or motion-caption, and it's a lot easier to sell Ray Liotta as Henry Hill in <em>Goodfellas</em> than as the voice of Tommy Vercetti in <em>GTA: Vice City</em>. With the exception of athletes or a <em>50 Cent: Blood on the Sand</em> situation, an actor's role in a game, no matter how many lines of dialogue, isn't large enough to merit a concentrated marketing effort, meaning we're left with the lead developers to sell an audience on a game's merit.

In film criticism there's a concept called auteur theory, which a posits that a director is the primary artist of a film, allowing a distinct style to emerge - Quentin Tarantino's stylized violence and non-linear narratives; David Lynch's surrealism and fascination with Laura Dern; Hitchcock's everything. That makes it easy to put a creative face to a movie, and it helps that they can be compelling, if somewhat eccentric, personalities.

With games, it's a little harder. Though the end product is often driven by a single vision - Brendan McNamara's reign over <em>LA Noire</em> studio Team Bondi can attest to that - will long development cycles, postponed release dates and well over 100 people performing vastly different jobs, it's a little harder to present a game as one person's vision. Game development still has its fair share of interesting personalities - Cliffy B, Tim Schafer, John Romero - but in a lot of cases, if we carry over auteur theory from film, it's more likely to apply to a studio than any one person. Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gta_iv" target="_blank">Wikipedia article for GTA IV</a> - you've got an art director, two technical directors, three producers and two writers. Of course people involved in film and games need to specialize, but it becomes hard to pinpoint that creative vision to one individual.

That doesn't mean it can't happen though, and like a lot of things in this industry, media presence will improve with time. Jimmy Fallon recently had a week-long feature on games, and there's no doubt that a Ken Levine or a Gabe Newell or a Cliff Bleszinski could make for interesting guests on <em>The Daily Show</em>, NPR or <em>Conan</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ban It! A Look At Why Games May Not Involve Contemporary Conflicts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Games that try to highlight current conflicts through games should be appreciated as legetimate attempts at artistic vision, but unfortunately such attempts have rarely been met with joy and open arms, more often the opposite, i.e. exasperated criticism and closed minds. This is unfortunate - games have a unique capacity to depict contemporary conflicts through interactivity, potentially evoking a greater response from players than if they were to read news articles on the same topic. For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketingvox.com%2Fvideo-games-may-foster-teen-civic-engagement-041066%2F" target="_blank">this</a> survey suggests that half of all gamers consider moral and ethical questions during gaming. In the following, I'll go through three examples of recent games that all received quite similar criticism for their settings at the time of their announcement, and then attempt to unveil the reasons for why games seem to be banned from portraying the current state of the world.

The first game on the line is the Medal of Honor reboot from 2010. Medal of Honor takes place in the mountains of Afghanistan during the 2001 invasion and Operation Anaconda in March 2002, and as in any Medal of Honor or Call of Duty game, the player observes this conflict through several soldiers' eyes. The sheer audacity of setting a game during a war that was still being fought was apt to elicit criticism; however, that wasn't the sole reason for the criticism MoH received. Instead, the game was criticized for having a multiplayer section in which the player could choose to play as a Taliban fighter. From British Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-11056581" target="_blank">Liam Fox</a> to Eurogamer's <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2Fmedal-of-honor-multiplayer-beta-hands-on%3Fpage%3D2" target="_blank">Dan Whitehead</a> the decision was met with anger and cautious disgust respectively. The end result was that EA, the game's publisher, decided to remove the word Taliban from the multiplayer section, and instead call them the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2F2010%2F10%2F04%2Fea-defends-taliban-name-change-in-medal-of-honor%2F" target="_blank">Opposing Force</a>.While it didn't cause the US Army, who had said that they would not be selling the game at army bases, to pull back their criticism of the game, it did seem to end the discussion, although instead it angered some gamers who did not support EA's <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.g4tv.com%2Fthefeed%2Fblog%2Fpost%2F707723%2Freacharound-medal-of-honors-patriotism%2F" target="_blank">sudden decision</a>.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/127714-sixdaysinfallujah.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7350" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/127714-sixdaysinfallujah.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="341" /></a>

Before the Medal of Honor incident, there had been a somewhat similar case regarding a game named Six Days in Fallujah. It was under development by Atomic Games, slated to be published by Konami, and was about the second battle of Fallujah in 2004, where US soldiers encountered some of the toughest fighting in the Iraq War, sustaining nearly <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fmilitaryhistory.about.com%2Fod%2Fconflictiniraq%2Fp%2Ffallujah.htm" target="_blank">500</a> killed and wounded. While Atomic Games were working on different projects, they were approached by some veterans of the battle, who wished that their experiences there <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Flatimesblogs.latimes.com%2Ftechnology%2F2009%2F04%2Ffallujahgamekonami.html" target="_blank">should be conveyed through a video game</a>, rather than more conventional mediums, and the developers described the game as being more about survival-horror than pure action as seen in other first-person shooters. Like Medal of Honor, Six Days in Fallujah was harshly criticized straight after its announcement, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-1168235%2FIraq-War-video-game-branded-crass-insensitive-father-Red-Cap-killed-action.html" target="_blank">by veterans and their relativ</a>es, stating that it was too early to portray the war, and one even called for a worldwide ban on the game. Subsequently, Konami pulled out of their position as publisher leaving the game hanging in limbo, and Atomic Games have evidently abandoned it releasing the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Fgame%2Fpc%2Fbreach" target="_blank">mediocre</a> Breach in the meantime.

Lastly, and most recently, there's Call of Juarez: The Cartel, the latest iteration in the Call of Juarez series, by Polish developer Techland, set in contemporary Mexico. More specifically, as the title implies, in Ciudad Juarez, a city plagued by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikinews.org%2Fwiki%2FCiudad_Juarez%2C_Mexico%2527s_murder_rate_becomes_world%2527s_highest" target="_blank">sky-high murder rates</a>, as over 2000 people were murdered in 2009, making the city the unofficial murder capital of the world. The staggering amount of murders is caused by internal strife between rivaling drug cartels. Call of Juarez: The Cartel, slated to be released on July 18, centers on this conflict, putting the player in the shoes of some seemingly <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepro.com%2Farticle%2Fpreviews%2F218490%2Fpax-east-call-of-juarez-the-cartel-preview%2F" target="_blank">unconventional law enforcement agents</a>. As in the other cases, The Cartel was almost instantly criticized for its setting, with former mayor Reyes-Ferriz stating that the situation is â€¦not something to be made light of and that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytech.com%2FCall%2Bof%2BJuarez%2BThe%2BCartel%2BAngers%2BCritics%2BMay%2Bbe%2BBanned%2Bin%2BMexico%2Farticle20968.htm" target="_blank">It's something that demeans our city</a>, and again there were people calling for a ban. In addition, in both <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamer.com%2F2011%2F02%2F22%2Fmexico-moves-to-ban-call-of-juarez-the-cartel%2F" target="_blank">Mexico</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fgamepolitics.com%2F2011%2F02%2F17%2Fcall-juarez-cartel-criticism-continues" target="_blank">US</a> the game was purported to have negative ramifications on children and young people, claiming that they might cause them to want to join gangs in response to what they see on screen.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/call-of-juarez-the-cartel.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7351" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/call-of-juarez-the-cartel.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="347" /></a>

Now it is evident that several similarities in the criticisms. Firstly, and most importantly, video games are seen as pure entertainment, rather than having the possibility of achieving the brand of art, or at least just to be placed side by side with other forms of expression, even if it is on Michael Bay-level. Secondly, several of the people speaking out state that they wish to ban the game, effectively wishing to perform censorship. Thirdly, they state that it's too soon to deal with these conflicts in a video game format. But why can films easily get away with some, at times, not exactly respectful depictions of contemporary conflicts?

If we move into the world of films, there have been created some notable movies about these conflicts in recent years. For example Once Upon a Time in Mexico, which features drug lords and political assassinations, or The Men Who Stare at Goats, which takes place during the Iraq War, where the main characters even drive on an IED, a method of warfare that has killed countless soldiers. The serious topics may be peripheral in the stories, but they are still actively used and made fun of. They're satirical. And from what I've seen of The Cartel so far, it seems to go more in a satirical direction, rather than having an entirely high-brow viewpoint on the conflict. Then why does it and not the similar films get criticized for dealing too lightly with the subject? As Blazej Krakowiak of Techland said at a preview showing, We're not crossing any lines that aren't crossed by other media. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepro.com%2Farticle%2Fpreviews%2F218490%2Fpax-east-call-of-juarez-the-cartel-preview%2F" target="_blank">It's not like we're jumping onto controversy he</a>re."

<strong>Interactivity</strong>

Games represent a vast leap from passive mediums, like films and books, as the player is in control of the actions. You, the player, consciously takes the decision to blast Pedro or Abdullah's brains out, or, perhaps more relevant, Bob's. For when the player is put in the shoes of one of the bad guys, it can easily appear to a non-gamer that this is purely for laughs, especially so when the game tries to attain a more serious tone. In the cinema, the audience can despise the actions of a character on screen, but that changes when you are in control of said character. This is also supported by Atomic Games President Peter Tamte, who claims that â€¦when you make the decision yourself, then you get a much <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joystiq.com%2F2009%2F04%2F13%2Fjoystiq-interview-six-days-in-fallujah%2F" target="_blank">deeper level of understanding</a>. Does interactivity suddenly mean that anyone who plays as the insurgents in Fallujah is suddenly a sympathizer with their motives? Of course not, rather it shows a wish for greater maturity in games,as conflicts in most other mediums may be shown from both sides, just like Tamte stated Six Days in Fallujah <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockpapershotgun.com%2F2009%2F04%2F08%2Fwarring-factions-six-days-in-fallujah-sparks-controversy%2F" target="_blank">aimed to do</a>.

<strong>The trouble with terminology</strong>

As the noun for our medium implies, games are clearly associated with playing. Even though games have come a long way from Pong to Six Days in Fallujah, a lot of the critics of the medium seem to be stuck in the past, however glorious it may have been, where the ultimate goal may have been little else than getting the highest score, and all the pretty colors and shapes merely existed to draw you in. At the dawn of gaming, games were more competitive and results-based, whereas the games of the present, to a greater degree, are experience-based. With story-driven games, the scoreboards dropped out of existence (this, of course, has been an evolution), and they mostly remain in arcade-like games. But the misunderstanding that the aforementioned games are purely for play and entertainment still prevails. They are said to be trivializing the conflict, reducing it to a hunt for points.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/medalofhonor4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7355" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/medalofhonor4.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="345" /></a></p>
<strong>Not for children</strong>

Another reason is that these games are claimed by critics of the industry to be intended and designed for children, and that bans may be necessary. What the critics fail to see is that whether or not children are exposed to the violence in the games is solely a parental problem, and if they are not capable of caring properly for their children, a state problem. The think of the children argument against video games is used extensively by critics, and there must be a limit to how much it can prevent adults from experiencing possible new narrative forms, and see that the industry might be mature enough to handle contemporary conflicts. Including violence in such games appears necessary, as war in its nature is quite violent. The "think of the children" argument was used in particular about The Cartel, as people feared that children and youths would begin to join gangs after being exposed to the game. The critics seem to negate the player controls a law enforcement agent, not a member of a cartel, meaning that game could just easily sway the gamer away from joining a gang. After all, the message If you join a gang, you will be filled with lead could be fairly resounding. Naturally, until the game is actually released, we can only speculate where the deeper aspects of the story might lead us.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>Maybe a shooter isn't the way to go</strong>

<strong></strong>There's no doubt that the up-front violence and aforementioned interactivity has an adverse effect on any uninvolved spectators. As such, first-person shooters may not be the way to go if we wish to portray modern conflicts. Medal of Honor might on the surface be claimed to be a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fmedal-of-honor-outrage-hurt-developer-185075.phtml" target="_blank">tribute</a> to the soldiers, but underneath it's little else than a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dr7lsDNWSnVo%26feature%3Drelated" target="_blank">simple</a> shooter. None of the games mentioned in this article have given or will likely give us an entirely accurate portrayal of the conflict, because ultimately they are "mere" entertainment This isn't documentarism after all, so perhaps we need to explore other genres to portray these conflicts. The same feelings Atomic Games were trying to evoke in the player could also be evoked if the player, instead of holding a gun in his hands, held, for instance, a camera, and in his role as a photojournalist put his life at risk trying to depict the conflict. A bit like the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalconflicts.eu%2Fproducts" target="_blank">Global Conflicts</a> games, but more fluid and hectic. Having the player controlling a gun seems like a cookie-cutter way of doing it, when in actuality there are limitless ways of portraying modern conflicts. The entire first-person perspective is dominated by FPSs (at least in mainstream gaming), and that is deeply unfortunate as the first-person perspective seems ideal to explore issues such as contemporary conflicts.

In the end, you might wonder: "Why? Why should the games bother trying to depict modern conflicts?" Well, for the same reasons as any other artistic form of expression should. That is, for instance, to show the emotional effect of the brutality of war on all sides in warfare, a concept that undeniably has shaped our species. That games wish to delve into these territories, without having to feel shamed into using pseudonyms or devise fictional conflicts, is a sign of a wish for maturity that must be nourished.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novelty_Header.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novelty_Header-300x168.jpg" alt="" title="Novelty_Header" width="512" height="288" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7409" /></a>

Games aren't new anymore.  They don't surprise us.

The common thesis around the internet is that there's nothing new in games because developers are creatively bankrupt.  There are no new ideas because no one has any except for independent developers; if big name developers have ideas, they're summarily crushed by publishers who want their games to fit easy points of comparison so they can get games journalists on their side.

In reality, I'm not sure that much has changed.  One thing, though, has definitely changed: how much we are informed about games before we play them.

As someone who played and bought games in the 90's, the biggest change between then and now is the amount of information we have about our games.  When Chrono Trigger was released, for instance, all we knew about it was that it was a JRPG from Squaresoft with characters that looked really weird (Dragon Ball hadn't permeated the culture yet, so only the hardest of the hardcore knew who Akira Toriyama was).  When we got into it, and we realized this game was about time travel, there was a moment of wonder: this game was so much cooler than it had seemed on the outside!

If you played games in the 90's, you remember games for their novelty.  Mario 3 had the boot that showed up in one level and changed mechanics before going away.  Super Mario RPG had these incredible characters you met who weren't part of the Mario universe, characters you didn't know anything about.

In some bizarro world where Mario RPG releases today, we'd have read long character bios of both Geno and Mallow.  We'd know they were coming.  There'd be no novelty to them, because they'd be cool people we'd expected to show up.  We'd probably fall asleep halfway through the sewers because what's coming wouldn't have been good enough to justify what we played.

This is a microcosm of the problem with games nowadays: we expect everything.  Few modern games can do anything to surprise us because we've read about everything in them before they release.  In the interest of making an informed decision, we've ruined the game we're about to buy.  We know what mechanics are going to show up, how they're going to change as the game goes on, and what we're going to have to do.  There's never any novel game mechanics because that would require the publisher to not try to sell their game to the most people.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novelty_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novelty_1-300x168.jpg" alt="" title="Novelty_1" width="528" height="295" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7408" /></a>

Look at Skyrim, a game we haven't played but know a lot about.  There are dragons in Skyrim.  This has been the major marketing push of the game: like Oblivion but with dragons.  I'm sure this excites some people, dragon fetishists mostly.  Personally, I would have been happy with Like Oblivion, but better.

Here's the place where the modern ruining of games comes in.  There are dragons.  We know that.  When you play Skyrim for the first time in November, and you first see a dragon, think about your thought process.  Is it going to be, Holy shit that's so fucking cool! or Man, I'm going to get me some cool dragon powers!  It's going to be the latter.  By revealing the dragons as part of marketing, they've been codified as a feature for the player to exploit rather than as a truly wondrous new thing.  They've never bee allowed to exist as a new feature; now they are something we expect with the package.  In another alternate world where Skyrim was just released in stores without publicity, with mysterious box art and absolutely no information, the first random dragon to attack you would have been a magical moment.

Those moments don't exist in mainstream games anymore.  There's never that sense of shock and surprise at a new, unanticipated event, but rather a sense of expectation and then disappointment that nothing new came up.  Of course there wasn't anything new: the newness has been beaten to death in the public arena by marketing goons.

Indie games, on the other hand, get away with having new ideas because no one's heard of them.  I still have no idea, really, what Frozen Synapse is about: when I play it, later today, it will be a novel experience because I'll have no preconceived notions going into it.  Other independent games benefit from this phenomenon.  For instance, Atom Zombie Smasher, a game I really liked, was made all the sweeter because I had an inaccurate view of it going in: I thought it'd be another zombie game, not a weird risk-management scenario with a crunchy leveling core.  Balloon Diaspora charmed me not because it was different but because it was unexpected.  Bangai-O Spirits captured my heart because I went in expecting a twin stick shooter and found the weirdest thing in the world.

On the other hand, I found Mass Effect 2 pretty bland and lifeless.  Is this because it was bland and lifeless, or was it because I already knew a lot about it when it launched?  Was it because the guns and conversation were boring, or because previews had me numbed to the twists and made me expect so much more?  I didn't like Dragon Age: Origins at first, because I'd hyped it up in my mind.  When I came back to it later, with fresh eyes, I saw its novelty and innovations for what they were, and I appreciated the game for them.  I have a gut feeling that if I ever go back to Final Fantasy XIII as someone not expecting the best game ever I might get a good game out of it.  I would look at the battle system and see the novelty; I'd hear the story with ears ready to receive it without preconceived notions.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novelty_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novelty_2-300x168.jpg" alt="" title="Novelty_2" width="580" height="326" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7407" /></a>

The trouble is this is a problem with no solution.  We can say we won't look at promotional media for games, but even the things we read about them can color our expectations into odd directions and paint the novel as old hat.  Even games you try carefully to avoid spoilers for (like I'm doing right now with Journey) comes with the difficulty of people talking about the game.  Spoilers exist, and we can't avoid them.  We can deal with them, but that's about all we have.

The crucial question is whether or not game writers should set their games up expecting inevitable spoilers of mechanics and plot.  On the one hand, we exist in a world where even the most novel ideas will be spoiled for us before we even unbox the game; on the other, spoiled mechanics are better than no new mechanics at all, which seems to be a modern trend in development.  Would you prefer a world like the one where video games are now, with spoiled mechanics, or a world like where other media are, where tropes are codified and ossified to the point where breaking them can make a work unmarketable?

It found a way to get people interested without ruining key elements in the film. By contrast, marketing for a movie like "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" makes me feel like I've already seen the film in its entirety. 

That said, part of the problem with AAA games is that people will sit on the fence if the marketing is <i>too</i> mysterious, because they're risking $60. Indie games, with their much lower prices, carry less risk. That can be fixed, but I doubt publishers will ever do that.]]></wp:comment_content>

^Exactly what happened to me. 


I think the other problem here is the transition from print media to online. When you talked about reading about Chrono Trigger you didn't do that online, you read that in Nintendo Power or EGM. When you only publish a few articles a month, shortish ones at that, you can leave out key details without ruining the new bits. But with online media people expect new information much more, sites like IGN are expected to push more articles than Nintendo Power ever would. And game publishers, eager to get their game out there, will keep providing them new info because it means more eyes on there game, even if that new info, at some point, becomes ruining new parts of the game.]]></wp:comment_content>

It's definitely how it went.  Print media doesn't have the possibility for relentless spoilers.  We could see screenshots and get dribblings of information, but we didn't get people releasing 8, 12, or 30 minutes of a new game for us to watch.  The game remains novel, and we become informed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In what's looking to be a huge year for Electronic Arts, the goliath publisher has acquired Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies developer PopCap for $750 million. This comes on the heels of EA launching its re-branded digital distribution service, Origin. Given the much publicized <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35247/Crysis_2_Removed_From_Steam.php">d</a><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35247/Crysis_2_Removed_From_Steam.php">isappearance of Crysis 2 from Steam</a> over "business terms" - specifically, the requirement that DLC and updates be processed through Steam servers - along with the impending launch of Battlefield 3 (which is also only available for pre-order on Origin), appears to indicate a triumvirate of big business expansions this year. With the acquisition of PopCap, EA have positioned themselves well to dominate the core and casual markets, no doubt aiming their sights firmly at Activision Blizzard and Zynga.

"We picked EA because they have recast their culture around making great digital games," said PopCap CEO David Roberts of the acquisition. "By working with EA, we'll scale our games and services to deliver more social, mobile, casual fun to an even bigger, global audience." EA CEO John Riccitellio echoed Roberts' sentiment, noting that "EA"s global studio and publishing network will help PopCap rapidly expand their business to more digital devices, more countries, and more channels."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mysteries pile up, crimes may occur, but Kyle Hyde is always ready! Ready to sell cleaning products, do the crosswords, play pool and, of course, hear about all your life's problems!

<strong>LAST WINDOW: THE SECRET OF CAPE WEST</strong> is a videogame developed by <strong>Cing</strong>, published by Nintendo for the <strong>Nintendo DS</strong>. It was directed by <strong>TAISUKE KANASAKI</strong>.
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7519" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Last-Window.png" alt="" width="252" height="227" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Last Window: The Secret of Cape West</em> may just be how books will be translated into games in the near future when paper is outlawed by environmentalist legislators and tablets start a Skynet uprising that will surely destroy the human race's tablet market. That will be the day we will experience Hemingway as it should be experienced: as a first-person walking simulator. Just how life is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ultimately, that's essentially what <em>Last Window</em> is: a walking simulator. You hold you DS sideways, point the little plastic stick (The stylus! Such an awesome name for such a silly thing) at some position on the map and you will rhythmically walk in that direction, with the sound of elevator music and your footsteps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These feet belong to Kyle Hyde, protagonist of<em> Hotel Dusk: Room 215</em>, a game that, according to Brendan Lee, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.actionbutton.net%2F%3Fp%3D25" target="_blank">was fucking trying</a> (as if one should reward intent rather than result). The problem of <em>Last Window</em> is that it is trying again. It's trying to tell me the exact same story. The nuances are a bit better, sure. Or rather: at least they are better. Characters are more wary of confiding in that stranger called Kyle Hyde, who, in turn, is less willing to act as a psychiatrist for anyone standing in the hallway. There is also a slight amount of tension - though it only lasts about 3 lines of dialogue. Best of all: there are no kids in the plot this time around.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, the novelty of the graphic style wore off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Here's the main thrust: one year after the last game, Hyde has just lost his job. He is the sort of gloomy guy that looks at the beer bottles on his kitchen sink and says "These bottles used to have booze in them, but now they are empty. Just how life is." Some old, wiser reviewers called him hard-boiled. I'm pretty sure that was just the black and white talking. From my experience, guys like Hyde are called emo nowadays. In fact, the greatest sense of achievement in this game, as well as in <em>Hotel Dusk</em>, is when you get a smile out of Hyde. Not a smirk. A full smile.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I bet these are the same reviewers who called <em>Hotel Dusk</em> a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fds%2Fadventure%2Fhotelduskroom215%2Freview.html%3Ftag%3Dsummary%253Bread-review" target="_blank">noir</a> game, just because it had a detective and it was in black and white. Only if Cing invented a new kind of noir, perhaps; some sort of new oneiric noir, where characters' worries and troubles are lifted by the nice man Hyde, instead of bringing them down to perdition. Hyde's own "Hard-boiled" cynicism is barely skin deep. The guy can't see someone standing still without rhythmically walking towards them to hear what the problem is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7515" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/lastwindow1.jpeg" alt="" width="384" height="256" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Not only has Hyde lost his job, but he is now facing eviction: the apartment building he lives in, Cape West, is closing its down. But instead of looking for a new place, he is trying to solve the mystery of the Scarlet Scar: a jewel long missing from that very building. The reason is because an anonymous letter told him to. Such is the power of anonymity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Maybe my tone is giving the impression this game is horrible. Trust me, this isn't my intention. <em>Last Window</em> is <strong><span style="color: #000080">schlock</span></strong>, yes, but only because it shares basically the same plot of<em> Hotel Dus</em>k: a web of mysteries woven by the incredible coincidence of every tenant being involved somehow in it - and I have already played <em>Hotel Dusk</em> countless (three, actually) times. <em>Last Window</em> hasn't learned anything. What aggravates the situation is that we are not talking about random hotel guest this time, but the actual neighbors of Kyle Hyde - and yet the game asks me to believe he isn't familiar with most of them!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Most of the joy in<em> Last Window</em>, however, derives from that weird unfamiliarity with Cape West. The game has its share of puzzles, sure. They are all topical and ranging from the retardedly easy to the obtuse. Still, unlike other adventure games like <em>Phoenix Wright</em> and <em>The Secret of Monkey Islan</em>d, solving them never makes you feel smart. Instead, this game excels in spatial exploration. As the game progresses and Hyde's morning rituals become more comforting, you start building a relationship with that virtual world. Slowly, you will feel like the king of Cape West. You will start to know where everyone lives and how their room is arranged to match their styles. When someone moved an object from its rightful place, that object becomes evident as it is not where it was supposed to be, which is crazy! The player becomes so drawn into that place that suddenly the location of the objects around you start to matter. I previously mentioned that books could be translated this way in a somewhat scornful manner, but frankly, the potential that is in there makes me giddy! Imagine experiencing <em>Crime and Punishment</em> in this fourth-walled medium! Hearing Raskolnikov's footstpes as if they were my own!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Alas, that potential is left untapped by <em>Last Windo</em>w. Sometimes it almost feels like the story was over before the game begun, as Hyde will be usually just talking about things that have already happened. As the geographical scope of the game is limited to Cape West, most revelations are delivered to you by Hyde's friends via telephone. Other times, you play a Q&amp;A test with the other tenants and they will tell you what you need to know. If you fail, you get a Game Over screen, meaning that Hyde curiosity wasn't quenched. This is a very unique failure status when you think about it. Shouldn't that frustration itself be the real punishment, instead of merely making the player restart the game?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There were also interludes, during which Hyde will take walks, go to the movies and enjoy other activities that shows he is not the indoor shut-in he actually is. But the gamer doesn't partake in those either. It's like Hyde felt bored and decided to leave the player alone for a while. Sure, neither of these activities advances the plot. They are not exactly storytelling. But this is the video game bullshit games have to endure due to their interactive nature in order to preserve immersion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">All those points together are very disconcerting. All of the sudden, I don't feel I am Kyle Hyde anymore, despite the first person perspective. I don't feel like I'm the hero of my own story. In fact, I don't even feel the Hyde is living the game's story - but merely hearing it from other people. In <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>2, Hideo Kojima managed to pull a prank on all of us, by forcing us to take control of an avatar we didn't want to and forcing us to see the character we desired to be only from a distance (he later tried that again in <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>, but wasn't so successful). In <em>Last Window</em> I am the guy I wanted to be (read: the only ex-cop in the premises) but it still feels like I'm watching him from afar.</p>


[caption id="attachment_7516" align="aligncenter" width="384" caption="Just how life is"]<img class="size-full wp-image-7516" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/lastwindow2.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="256" />[/caption]
<p style="text-align: center"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are two new additions <em>Last Window</em> has over <em>Hotel Dusk</em> and they are so peculiar, I cannot resist mentioning it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first one is a book - an actual book - of the game's plot. That is exactly as you've read: a book that tells the same story you have just played. Just like <em>Farmville</em> rewards its players with the ability to play <em>less Farmville</em>, so does <em>Last Window</em>: next time you feel like relieving the mystery of the Scarlet Star, you wonâ't need to poke with your stylus around useless trash and hear Hyde compare his empty beer bottles to life. The backfire is evident as reading the book makes it clear <em>Last Window</em> is the story of a story being told.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second one is a much needed "ignore" feature, which allows players to simply - and thankfully - ignore (read, save) characters from Hyde's question-making impulses . Too bad it is barely used. Only once I got a Game Over for not ignoring someone. On the other hand, if you choose ignore something, chances are Hyde will stop and think to himself that yes, maybe he should have inquired over that one particular line he ignored after all - then proceeding to void your decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the end, if you are sad you weren't able to get a copy of <em>Last Window</em> because it wasn't released over the Americas, don't be. The secret of Cape West is a very interesting one. Too bad the gamer never take an active part into its revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

Infested Planet is a game I'm excited to see evolve, as it  has the  potential to be a unique and engaging RTS unlike any I have played  before. There are no resources to harvest.  You start with all of your units, and the only buildings you construct are turrets. It's a squad based game where you take five to six marines and attempt to claim territory from nasty alien bugs. The traditional values of the RTS are  out the window: no more resource wars, no more strength in numbers.  Infested Planet is a different beast.
<div>

Your team begins as default assault units, and they have grenades that use a shared ammo pool that replenishes and standard machine guns. This little team is what makes Infested Planet stand out. There are five of the same unit, all of which respawn at death without any resource cost to the player and with only a minor time punishment. The most the player can bolster numbers by is one additional unit.  The strategy of the game is much more  small scale then is traditionally seen in an RTS, and it contrasts well with the enemies of the game.  Enemy locations constantly spawn rivers of  bugs at the player and the screen can quickly fill with writhing masses  of them. You need to constantly push these waves back and claim territory from the bugs, and this little team is all you have to push them with.

[caption id="attachment_7531" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Look at them all!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SO-MANY-BUGS.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7531 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SO-MANY-BUGS.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

Of course, playing an entire game with just five or six of the same unit would amount to a boring experience, but this concern is alleviated by specialization. By  spending build points, you can upgrade your units to unique roles like  sniper, flamer, minigun, medic, or a dude with an explosive shotgun.  Each plays a unique role in combat and mixing these roles up is the key to victory. The flamer can keep crowds at bay while the sniper picks off defensive towers one shot at a time, the medic is keeping everyone  alive, and the minigun guy is tearing everything apart like he should.  The trick to this is balancing those build points. Points are an  incredibly limited resource only acquired by taking enemy positions or  dragging boxes of points back to base. Each role requires a different  amount of build points to train, points that you get back if you revert to a normal unit. The real meat of it comes when you start to sweat over where to spend the points, on unit upgrades, turrets, or research.
<div>

Turrets are the only defense you have, and they cost points you could use on the squad. This means you are often left making a choice between protecting territory or strengthening your ability to attack targets. If  the level generation was in your favor, this can lead to satisfying  puzzle solving moments of tackling the level in just the right way.  Other times you just feel like your bashing your face against a wall, but we'll get to the level generation and difficulty curve in a bit.  Turrets come in bullet, mortar, and massive death machine flavor, with  some mines, protective barriers, and teleporters thrown in as well, just  to be sure you have plenty of things to agonize over building in any  given scenario. Do you save up for the massive rocket turret with the  range of a small area code or do you invest in teleporters to get your  squad to territory under attack by the aliens? Shield walls or mortar  turrets?

[caption id="attachment_7528" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Precious points!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BP-Gained.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7528 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BP-Gained.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

Or instead of unit upgrades or mechanical advancements, do you invest in some research? Why you could  generate base mounted turrets and the capacity for self building turrets, freeing up your units to fight rather then build. Upgrade to  plasma grenades or increase your amount of ammo for grenades?  Regenerating health, shared health among units, or just an additional unit? You have lots of things to spend an agonizingly small amount of  build points on, and what combinations you use and when you opt to sell old  purchases for emergency points are the keys to victory. If you want to  survive, the battlefield will need to constantly shift to reflect the  current situation, your units and tactics need to evolve as rapidly as  the enemy you fight.
<div>

With every hive you take over and convert to a base, the enemy evolves to retaliate. It may grow armor on units and buildings, clone your units for a devastating  attack on your territory with your own team layout, or generate tough defensive units to guard bases. As you gain build points to change and  advance your attack, the enemy is doing the same and constantly pumping  out more units and splitting its attacks up on the map. When it works,  it works well. It turns a RTS into almost a puzzle game, with the player needing to take positions and adapt in different sequences to ensure victory.  Which is why its such a shame when it doesn't work because the level  generation decides that humanity does not deserve to be happy.

[caption id="attachment_7530" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="&quot;Oh hi! Have some rocket death!&quot; Fuck you turret."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuck-that-turret.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7530 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuck-that-turret.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

That's  what it feels like at least.  When you press the start button and find  your starting location within the line of sight of an enemy controlled  siege cannon. I can just imagine the look on the poor faces of my units, as they materialize in the world ready to fight and the first thing they  see are hundreds of rockets exploding in their faces. This is  essentially an instant lose scenario, and as the game tries to ramp up  difficulty, it happens with increasing frequency. As of this writing I  have tried twenty times to beat a level called Ruins; six of those times I had that massive death machine as a neighbor eager to give me baskets  of flaming pain as welcoming gifts. Four of those times placed me in  the center of the map surrounded by four or more enemy bases spawning  units at me--not instant flaming death, but still certain doom. Three times the first enemy mutations were the much more difficult ones to  counter early in, like clones, protobase attacks which spawn mini bases  nearby that attack in waves, or other such scenarios where the  difficulty spikes absurdly early into the map. The rest of the time I just died as the opposition spawned more and more difficult mutations, being unable  to defend half the map while trying to attack, constantly losing border  bases and being beaten down by clone attacks.
<div>

After the last friendly neighbor situation I gave up.  As frustrating as the other situations are, I just don't have the patience for 1/4th of my  attempts starting in an instant lose scenario. Randomly generated levels can be a great thing in games, but for this game, I'm not sure I  believe they are beneficial after this. They would need some balancing  to ensure a consistent experience for the player, guaranteeing a start location free of rockets for instance, and perhaps keeping it at least  somewhat defensible. Half the time you start a level and you're in a nook  and life is good. The other half you are in the video game equivalent of one rough neighborhood, and life is filled with pain and gangs of aliens who snap their fingers rhythmically at you. A difficulty curve  shouldn't shift as violently as an elected official's stance on the tough issues, it should stick to progressively getting harder in a manner that's manageable. No one wants a game that reverses its stance on net  neutrality, or one that's just randomly impossible either. If anything needs to be fixed during the beta period, this is the big one, this is  the game killer while other problems are just bearable nuisances.

[caption id="attachment_7533" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="A bird's eye view of impending doom."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-situation.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7533 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-situation.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

The  main nuisances for me are sound related, specifically a lack of sounds.  With no music the game is audibly barren, and it also lacks sound cues  to alert the player to deaths, respawns, locations being under attack or lost; it's basically limited to the sounds of gun fire and squishing.  Having these kinds of sounds would greatly improve player awareness of  the state of play.  AI pathing also needs some work.  If you right click  on a location for a unit to move to, it will walk there oblivious to everything around it except for the rocks that divide up the level. You cheer as the little dude navigates around the rock, and then sob as he lets enemies eat him while he walks in place against the side of a  building. The lack of self preservation is cured by using the assault  button to assign movement orders, units can still end up walking in place against a wall, but at least they shoot the ghoulies out to eat them as they do it. This is crucial when the hives mutate land mines,  because they love to skip over those bad boys like kids in an antiwar commercial unless they are told to assault the place you want them to walk to.
<div>

My last complaint isn't a bug or an issue found in the game that will hopefully be patched during beta.  It's an absence. The game has no story of any kind in the build I played--you open in tutorials devoid of any substance outside of mechanics and  proceed from there. I have no idea who my units are or represent, or why the aliens are here determined to own the planet. For that matter, what planet are we even on? Why is it exclusively underground caves?  Is the  surface lethal or something?  The graphic design of the game is so  beautiful and compelling to look at, why not give me a hint of a  narrative to really keep the hook in place? Right now the game has no personality.  The lack of music, voices, dialogue, and the like makes the game seem so much more sterile and hollow then it needs to be. Give me a colorful world to match the wonderful design the rest of the game displays, give me a reason to keep playing despite the migraine level frustration of rockets bombarding me before the screen is even done  fading in the environment. The biggest thing that makes this game stand  out is the limit of five or six marines facing living seas of aliens, I  should care about those units more then I do now, make them feel alive.  It would make the premise that much stronger.

[caption id="attachment_7532" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Like a living river of doom."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Streams.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7532 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Streams.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>[/caption]

Infested  Planet is like a half finished painting.  What you see is a thing of beauty for sure, but so much is missing that you just can't feel the impact you just know the final work will have on you. I'm hopeful that the beta period will resolve the issues I faced, because it does stand to one day be a unique entry to the RTS genre. It's a  handful of units against a world of constantly evolving enemies.  Everything you do needs to be changed constantly to stay viable in the  field.  It's micromanagement on every level of play, and it's unlike any  RTS I have ever played. If you want something different from your RTS  experience, then keep your eyes on this one through its beta, because it's something else. Then again, if you really want to get involved with it now, grab the beta and give the team feedback to make sure this one arrives as a stellar release. You can check it out at the developers  site <a href="http://www.rocketbeargames.com/infestedplanet/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Cold Season is an exploration of independent video game Iron Grip: Warlord, a FPS/Tower Defense hybrid available via Steam et al.  It's quite good, and worth checking out, especially if you have friends to play it with.  This is a look at the game's strongest part, its atmosphere and its portrayal of war.</em>

Khristos, when will there be another attack? I ask the thin man sitting next to me, smoking a cigarette.  I don't expect an answer.  I'm playing with the barrel of my musket, the mechanical components worn because I swiped it from the corpse of another man, Oleg, on the battlefield outside some nameless castle.  When soldiers come with sandbags I tell  them where to put them.  Another man arrives with the barrel of an anti-tank weapon, and I tell him to set up behind the statue in the square.

We are in the suburbs, outside the Maces Grand Palace.  Our orders are simple: fend off a Confederate incursion.  We don't know that there will be one, but we wouldn't be here if there wasn't going to be an attack.

Khristos? I ask him again.  He still doesn't respond.  He's looking at the sunset behind the buildings like it's the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

Don't you think all these people would be better off? he asks me.

Better off without what? I ask.  The suburbs around the palace have been civilian shelters since the start of the war, for refugees of the Confederate invasion.

Better off without us.  Without war.  Without guns or explosions, he pauses, taking a drag on his cigarette.  They'd be better off without us.

I stare down the road, and I hear the rumbling of tires.  I know the Confederates will be here, and they will bring guns with them.  I wonder what Khristos knows that I do not know.  I wonder if what he knows will help him get through the battle ahead, or whether it will be a liability, one that will make him party to the enemy.  I contemplate turning him in to my commanding officer, Maicos, but I decide against it.

Besides, his gun is just another to replace mine when he dies in the name of our glorious cause.  I hear the war cry of the Confederates, and I offer my own in response.

Iron Grip: Warlord is the game a student of history envisions when he hears of games about warfare.  It is not Call of Duty, where ultra fast man-children prance about bragging about headshots, but rather an inevitable, deathly struggle with an overwhelming invading force.  It's about making each and every man count, until you've beaten back the tides of your oppressors.

It is war as strategy and war as twitch.  Strategy is required to weather the storm, but twitch is required to win the day.  Strategy can only deliver you a stalemate, a permanent grind of your troops against their troops, and while they're giving up a hundred men to your one they have a hundred more to give.  You set this strategy, and then you play hunter-killer: the man who will go out and kill the enemy officer, the unit worth more than three hundred enemy soldiers.

I watch Yurias and another man dive headlong into the Confederates, chewing up two dozen of them with light machine gun fire before they're taken down by a man with the biggest gun I've ever seen.

Khristos is still alive, ducking in and out of buildings next to quaking civilians, huddled in the corners.  He takes pot shots at enemy troops, desperate to stay alive.  I do similarly, ducking into a tunnel underneath the city to avoid a steady stream of gunfire.  Olaf, our gunner, lays down suppressing fire a street up, taking as many Confeds down as he possibly can.

Like shooting fish in a barrel! I shout to Khristos, my enthusiasm betrayed by the knowledge I could be dead at any second.  These Confederate dogs die like anyone else!

Khristos turns to me, and the building he is inside goes up in an explosion of inhuman fury.  He disappears in seconds, almost as if he were never there, as two civilians, two men, fly from the huddled safety of the floor above.

Keep fighting! a man named Yurias, a different Yurias, shouts.  Those bastards may kill civilians, but we'll be stronger for it.  I wonder if there will be another Khristos, another man to take his place.  I wonder how expendable we really are to the country.

You play Iron Grip: Warlord like a first person shooter, but you don't tend to think about it like a first person shooter.  It's a strategy game where you shoot the nameless mass pushing towards you.  It's a strategy game where you walk forward with your compatriots and die, taking as many bastards with you as possible.

This is not a game about killing: this is a game about death.  Most first person shooters glorify the kill: when you kill, it is glorious, and when you die, you are a stepping stone for someone else's glory.  Not in Iron Grip.  Here, there is only death.  When you walk from base with your five closest friends, you know that there is no way you will ever return.  You will run into a group of twenty enemy soldiers, a tank, and an officer with the biggest gun you've ever imagined, and the glory is in taking as many of them with you as possible.

You will die, and then you will come back and do it again, because you are imminently replaceable.  And you will barely make a difference: the line between success and failure is getting the opportunity to go out and die again.

I begin to wonder why we fight at all.

I've heard all the rhetoric, all the words between both sides, and yet I see the way this war is going.  We, the good guys, keep losing battles, keep falling back with the enemy on our heels.  The enemy, for their part, hit wherever they want with impunity, and no matter the losses they have the manpower to push through and destroy us.

And we don't have the manpower to answer them.

Captain Kaminsky tells us otherwise.  I'm back in base, a lull in the fighting, getting my weapon outfitted.  He tells me, Andreas, you must not worry about territory.  War is not fought over territory.  War is fought over individuals, over their hearts and minds.

But these individuals are being killed by mortar fire, I tell him.

And every civilian who dies at the enemies hands will inspire another ten to rise up and take arms against the Confederates.  This is not a war we can win today, Andreas, but one we can win in months, in years.

I swallow his words, and they are like a peach pit sticking in my throat.  I hear the sounds of bullets and screaming from the block below, cock my rifle, and I remember how the battles had ended in the forests, in the hills, in the cities where the Confederates had fought in the past.  I swallow deeply and rejoin the fray, bullets whizzing past my ears.

Iron Grip features a number of fascinating mechanics.  It has a complex leveling system powered by how many enemies you kill (your kills also determine victory, as you have to kill enough enemies to demoralize the enemy), which lets you improve the troops you have with you.  You can give them better weapons, more health, et cetera, and the results are immediately obvious on the field.

My favorite feature, though, is that you get extra resources for every civilian the enemy kills.  It's a small touch, but such a fascinating one.  War games, in general, try to undervalue the suffering of those not directly involved in conflict: Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has no desire to think about the people who used to live in the houses you're now obliterating.  Those people might as well not exist, because their existence could serve to decimate the illusion it tries to generate: war is fun.

And war, Iron Grip wants to remind you, is not fun.  It is the breaking down of social civility to such a level that people's lives, the most valuable things, are reduced to commodities that aren't even counted.  So civilians will die throughout the course of a game, and when the enemy kills them they will serve as resources you can use to build up your troops or your structures.  With better troops and better defenses, you have a greater chance of stopping the invasion cold.

They're retreating! the cry begins from the front.  We're winning!

Just a little bit more and we'll have them on the ropes, Captain Kaminsky hollers, and we charge back into the breach like we were trained to do.  Khristos takes a light rifle into cover and takes shots at the enemy, while Yurias sets up a heavy machine gun to lay down fire on the approaching Confederates.  We can see it in their eyes: they are beaten, and we will be victorious.  We will have held our ground against the enemy.  This will have been a grand victory for our government, and from here we could move forward and conquer other territories.

The enemies' spirits break, and we are on top of them in an instant.  As our bullets cut through the enemy, I hear a siren off in the distance, signaling a retreat.  Khristos looks down at the dirt, now a copper red, and he begins to shake like he has seen a ghost.

Khristos?

We have won another meaningless victory, he says.  A couple civilians poke their heads out of a small building behind him, and they cautiously ask whether or not it's over.  I look at them and I tell them it's over as the siren blares a second time.  Khristos shakes his head again.

It will never be over, not until we are all dead and our country is razed.  Here, now, it will begin again.

I look up at the sky, and I see the ships above.  It is here that I see his meaning as fire overtakes me.

The cruel joke of Iron Grip is that you can never win.  Even if you manage to kill every enemy, force them to retreat, you still lose.  You still die.  The bombs will still fall and they will obliterate all the work you put in.  If you're playing the levels of the game in order, each mission will see your side fall further and further behind the enemy, with the Confederates taking more and more territory.

The war is pointless, in the end.  No matter how well you fight the battle, no matter how your commando raids into enemy territory to kill bigwig officers go, you will die, and you will die permanently.  Your death is inevitable; your success or failure is only tied to the success or failure of a nameless, faceless cause.

Like in a real war, success is not winning or losing, it's how much you get out of the game.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Warning:</strong> This review contains detailed and unrestricted spoilers.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.neutronized.com/games/SkyIsland/" target="_blank">Sky Island</a> is a puzzle platformer starring a vaguely humanoid star who collects stars. If your mind isn't completely blown yet, let me add that you can collect coins for points, Goomba-stomp enemies and fall to your death via a bottomless abyss. Too pedestrian? Well, Sky Island includes the ability to horizontally rotate your two-dimensional perspective to bypass obstacles and rearrange the landscape to your advantage. Similar systems have appeared in games like Super Paper Mario and Miegakure, but the central mechanic most resembles the one in Fez, a currently unreleased puzzle platformer starring a vaguely humanoid thing who collects <em>cubes</em>.</p>


[caption id="attachment_7799" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Co-starring some of the tetrominoes from Tetris!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandPerspective.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7799" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandPerspective.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Sky Island is a puzzle platformer in the same way that Braid (which stars a vaguely humanoid thing who collects stars <em>and puzzle pieces!</em>) is; namely that while platforming skills and killing enemies are required to complete the game, they're mostly tangential. The focus is squarely on navigating and manipulating the environment in order to collect every star and then afterwards it shifts to reaching the checkered block that demarcates the end of each level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To add yet another comparison to the list, Sky Island is also like Portal in the sense that it consists largely of tutorials and then ends shortly after puzzle elements are combined to the point where things start to get interesting. I don't play puzzle-centric games all that often and I don't think I'm some kind of supergenius, so I'll attribute my ability to breeze through most of the game to it not being that difficult. There was only one moment in the entire game where I felt that I had to genuinely think about how to approach the problem at hand, and that was when star-carrying enemies first appeared.</p>


[caption id="attachment_7800" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Relieving enemies of their stars is where much of the game's challenge comes from. Too bad little else is challenging."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandShyguys.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7800" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandShyguys.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">After I eventually figured out what to do, I went back to (mostly) breezing through the levels as no further mechanics were added. Dishearteningly, much of the challenge in later levels devolves into finding the right sequence of pink blocks to manipulate. This makes the game become more of a memory challenge than a navigation challenge as all of the pink blocks look identical even if they transport you to completely different places. I occasionally had more trouble just getting to the exit than I did collecting the stars for this exact reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I was also a bit disappointed that there was an utter lack of story in the game. Puzzle games are not generally renowned for riveting tales, but you aren't given any kind of backdrop or explanation beyond a few signs in the beginning that serve as tutorial messages for the game's mechanics. Instead, you just continue to traverse environments comprised of floating platforms that give little sense of overall connectivity or continuity until you stumble upon a short and simple boss fight that results in a non sequitur congratulatory screen. The praise for completing the protagonist's quest, even if it's not a particularly deep story, might have had more impact if we knew literally <em>anything</em> about it beforehand. (Technically, a brief introduction does appear on some sites, though nonsensically it does<strong> not</strong> on the developer's official site, but nothing of the story manifests itself in-game until the end.) Though a game doesn't require a story to be good, the congratulatory screen in Sky Island implies that there was some kind of rudimentary story (when in fact there wasn't up until just then) and also serves as an example of a lame story being worse than none at all.</p>


[caption id="attachment_7801" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="YOU'RE WINNER !"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandYoureWinner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7801" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandYoureWinner.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The biggest thing that irks me is how it feels like some things from the platformer genre were crammed in without rhyme or reason, as if there was some kind of Decalogue for all games of this genre (First Commandment: "Thou shalt walketh to the right if thou doth wish to progress.") and the platforming elements couldn't just be another means to navigate the environment. For instance, why is there a final boss fight when no precedent for bosses was established? It comes off as wanting a climatic finale to the game and settling on a boss battle because of a misguided sentiment like "It worked in other games and it should work in ours!" To put it a different way, imagine if you were trying to solve a Rubik's cube and in order to finish you had to play a game of Simon. Or if you were doing a crossword puzzle and you had to play a timed version of connect-the-dots at the end. Though the boss was an easy fight, it just didn't mesh well with the rest of the game, and it's made worse by involving very little puzzle-solving since there are an extremely limited number of actions you can perform in the corresponding level. Considering the rest of the game, it would have made a lot more sense to just end with a really hard and/or unique puzzle.</p>


[caption id="attachment_7802" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Note the highly restricted environment of the level for the final boss."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandBoss.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7802" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SkyIslandBoss.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Though the Shyguy-esque enemies serve as perfunctory antagonists, I won't give them a free ride for being generic. Not knowing specifically why you kill the enemies is often not a big deal since such a lack of knowledge is common in many games, but it bugs me in this game because they aren't very antagonistic in the first place. The Shyguys move slowly, are nonaggressive and hinder you only by denying access to some stars. You lose one of three hit points for touching them, but otherwise they are harmless. It feels like I'm being told by convention that: "You kill them because they are there, because that's what you do in a platformer. You kill little waddling enemies by stomping on their heads." It reminds me of my experience with Cactus' Space Fuck, where you could kill and destroy things despite the things in question not retaliating or provoking you. Sometime after playing that Cactus game, an unsettling feeling crept up on me when I realized that I only (initially) reacted to the presence of a new environment filled with structures and living things by killing and destroying because, irrespective of whether one actually needs to perform such an action, that's what's been programmed into us as a normal response to such things in platformer-shooter hybrids. The similar cognitive dissonance I get from playing Sky Island is probably not aided by me perceiving the Shyguy enemies as so damn cute. Definitely cuter than the protagonist anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The only other threat is some kind of fire-spitting thing, and even then it's immobile, invulnerable and more annoying than it is dangerous. The only time you are liable to be hit by its projectiles is when you accidentally rotate the world in such a way that you end up directly in its line of fire, and it feels like nothing less than the level designer being kind of a jerk. The fire-spitters could be completely replaced by obstacles in the form of two stacked blocks, and the purpose they serve would be almost identical though less deadly and annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The lack of a level select function reiterates the feeling of the environments having little connectivity or continuity as a whole, but I was distressed by this moreso because I had no way to gauge my progress. Whenever I had trouble finding the exit of a level, I didn't know whether I should carry on because I was almost done with the game or if I still had tens or even hundreds of levels left to go! I knew I made <em>some</em> progress because new gameplay mechanics were tossed in, but I had no idea how <em>much</em> progress I made, and that bothered me somewhat. Not having a level select screen also means I couldn't go back and try levels a different way, perhaps to get more coins or try an alternative route if possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The ability to rotate the environment with 360° freedom is also strange as vertical rotation is of limited use. Sky Island could have just used a more straightforward approach like the environment shifting mechanics in Time Fcuk and the Shift series, but it instead allows for a greater range and fluidity of rotation by opting for the mouse instead of the keyboard. This isn't necessarily something reprehensible, but it comes off as more of a gimmick than a necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Though I have a lot of choice words and criticisms for Sky Island, it's not all bad. Though limited in scope, its aesthetic design and music are nice and when combined with a scoring system it's all reminiscent of the cutesy-yet-good style of Nitrome games. It's also delivered free of charge, so at least you can't complain about not getting your money's worth. Ultimately though, it's just a light snack that you quickly polish off before moving on. It's nifty for its novelty and weirdness, but I felt that it was more like a tech demo or proof of concept than a fully fleshed-out game and that it was overall too insubstantial and unchallenging to be engaging for more than a brief moment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rock-paper-scissors  is the ultimate game of weaknesses and advantages.  No matter how many  times you play rock will always smash scissors, scissors will always cut  paper, and paper will always cover rock, somehow resulting in paper  winning.  I never figured that one out, either.  Regardless of the  source of paper's rock-crushing ability, the triangle of destruction  will never be compromised.  Rock-paper-scissors, though too  simple on its own to go much further than a quick problem-solving  method, has its core principle used in many other games.

[caption id="attachment_8219" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="It's a vicious cycle"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8219" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/rock-paper-fire-8215/300px-rock_paper_scissors/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8219" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/300px-Rock_paper_scissors.jpg" alt="rock paper scissors" width="300" height="240" /></a>[/caption]

Weaknesses, and thus by  association advantages in games are a long-standing mechanic that  creates a need for strategy, and I have yet to see a game that did not  get better when it made the player think a little.  Tactics games, both  real-time and turn-based, usually have the most clear and  straightforward weakness/advantage systems.  Fire Emblem has a perfect  rock-paper-scissors analogy with its weapon triangle system.  In all but  the earliest games in the series, different weapon types give  characters an increased hit chance against another weapon type and an  increased miss chance against the final.  For example, swords are good  against axes, but bad against spears.  Axes beat spears, and spears beat  swords.  Because of this system, anyone not wanting to lose a character  would never pit a swordsman up against a spearman.  Almost every time,  the swordsman would lose, and his turn or life would have been wasted.   Spells worked in much the same way, as three of the elements used had a  similar triangle system going.  Plus, special characters like pegasus  knights had their own strengths and weaknesses--being able to fly over  any terrain and hard to hit up close, but were doomed if faced with even  a single archer.  The weaknesses of characters forces players to pick  and chose their actions carefully, as pitting something up against its  weakness would rarely if ever end well.  Imagine a (modern) Fire  Emblem  without the weapon triangle.  The tactics and strategies would be far  different, and level and stats would be the primary factor in deciding  who goes in and who does not.  The variety of sorties would be  diminished, and the game would not be nearly as engaging as it is with  the triangles in place.

What always come to my mind first at the mention of  weaknesses is Pokemon.  The seventeen types of Pokemon  and all  their resistances, immunities, and weaknesses are what make combat in it  so unique.  No, it is not the only turn-based RPG with weaknesses and  resistances, but they are far more important than in, say, Final  Fantasy or  Y's, and just like in Fire Emblem, pitting a pokemon up  against something it can only be not very effective against is almost  always a bad move, as is challenging something strong against you.   There are even a couple of type triangles in Pokemon, like the  fire-water-grass starters in every generation.  Players pick their teams  and moves around countering weaknesses as much as if not more than they  do around dealing damage, but unless the counter is a switch out,  trying to hold one's own against a weakness is still a gamble.

[caption id="attachment_8217" align="aligncenter" width="663" caption="Only 17 types and it's made billions of dollars"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8217" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/rock-paper-fire-8215/pkmn-type-chart/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8217" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pkmn-type-chart.jpg" alt="17 types" width="663" height="444" /></a>[/caption]

If Final  Fantasy  had more influential weaknesses, the series would be much more tactical,  would require more thought, and thus would be stronger as a whole.  The  series does have weaknesses and resistances in its elements, but unless all you fight is flans,  they usually have little to no consequence. I like the Final  Fantasy  franchise as much as the next Jrpg player, but it has always bothered me  that they went through all the trouble of integrating an element system  only to use it  for one  or two enemies or as an excuse for more flashy animations.  If enemies  took more noticeable damage or had an extra penalty for being nailed by  their weakness, the need or desire for elements goes up.  FFX, while not applying  to all foes, had many enemies that had to be hit with the weaknesses or a  certain status ailment or a specific strategy in order to be dealt  reasonable damage.   Lulu, the black mage character, was by far one of  the most valuable because she could target weaknesses, and doing so made  fights noticeably shorter.   Weaknesses played a major part in FFX compared to many of  the others, and for that I applaud it.

Now I have been doing a lot of  talking about turn-based games, but even the adventure genres (be it  action adventure, adventure RPG, point-and-click adventure, the list goes on) has been  unable to escape the use of weaknesses.  What makes for a good adventure  game? Let us start with a classic: hitting dudes with swords. Always  fun.  You can even get more sword abilities or different weapons or  tools as the game progresses.  Even better.  All the enemies can be  different, with different attack patterns and such, but when it comes  right down to it you are still doing little more than avoiding attacks  and hitting dudes with a sword, or an axe, or a bow, or whatever smiting  tool you brought with you that day.  What if, though, all the enemies  have a specific weakness or way to beat them, like they'll block all  attacks from the front but have a vulnerable back, or they fly around  fast so hitting them with your sword is difficult, or they do not drop  their guard unless they bounce off your shield, or you have to send  their attacks back at them from a distance, since they hide if you get  close.  Any of this sounding familiar?  It should, since they are all  enemies from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  In OoT, most of the enemies  could only be defeated by exploiting a weakness--be it a weakness of the  enemy like bombs or arrows, or a weak point like most of the bosses, OoT  and  nearly every other   Zelda title are adventure  games based around weaknesses.  For another, rather different example of  a franchise about exploiting weaknesses, Megaman and its bosses are  perfect.  Each boss has a weapon they are cripplingly weak against, but  all of these weapons must be obtained from another boss.

[caption id="attachment_8216" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="I wonder what her weakness is/"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8216" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/rock-paper-fire-8215/queen_gohma_pic/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8216" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/queen_gohma_pic.jpg" alt="giant armoured arachnid" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]

Something I would like  to see more of, though, is a game where you as the main character have a  crippling weakness, and not something like he/she cannot swim, because  apparently most protagonists never learned how. Perhaps something that,  if fought, will almost  certainly kill you, and unless you come back with something specially  purposed for overcoming this weakness, you will not stand a chance. Of  course this new weakness-beater has a weakness of its own.  Game  protagonists seem to have a distinct lack of weaknesses, probably so  that players do not fear taking anything on, but I want a game where you  as a player are genuinely afraid of this weakness being exploited,  just  as we as players have done to so many of our enemies.

Though again a  turn-based example, Persona 3 and 4 have a weakness  systems that encourages caution and has personally resulted in more than  a few moments of sheer horror.  Being hit by your weakness means not  only taking extra damage, but you also risk losing your turn and give  the enemy that hit you an extra turn.  Sticking your weakness out for  the enemy to strike is asking to die.  Persona is only half of what I  want, though, as you can change your weaknesses at will.  Zelda  Majora's Mask also has a few crippling weaknesses with the transforming masks.   The zora, for example, goes  down if touched by fire, but there is usually little stopping the player  from simply avoiding zora form around fire.

To me, the ideal  weakness game is one where you play as paper.  You have a reliable way  to topple rocks, but when a pair of scissors shows up you best start  running.  Perhaps you can switch between rock paper or scissors at save  points or by beating that kind of enemy (beating a rock lets you become a  rock), but not at will.  Rock-paper-scissors is the perfect game of  weaknesses. Why not make a more complex game out of it?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Marketing video games must be a bitch of a job. In most cases you're targeting the coveted 18-39 male demographic, and video game culture being what it is, the audience is going to absolutely abhor you should you misrepresent or over-hype the game in the slightest. Moreover, there aren't too many success stories you can use as a reference point - for me, at least, when I think of game PR campaigns, I think of John Romero promising to make everyone his bitch, Dead Space 2 being sold as a game your mom's going to hate, the fake fundamentalists protesting Dante's Inferno at E3, and the impossibility of Duke Nukem being worth 13 years of development hell. Even fanboy favorite Valve copped abuse for their Portal 2 Potato Sack ARG which saw the game released on Steam 10 hours early.

Flying Cow Studios hope that Hard Reset will avoid all that. Announced just last week, Hard Reset is due for release in September. That's a two month marketing campaign. Tom Ohre of Evolve PR, the game's marketing agency, explains their approach.

"Now, the biggest problem with extended PR campaigns is the fact that between major milestones like the announcement, big trailers and preview opportunities, you're dealing with a lot of dead time, where gamers are off looking at other stuff while you prepare the next build or movie or whatever," wrote Ohre, who previously worked for several years promoting Dragon Age, The Witcher and Neverwinter Nights. "By condensing six months to a year of assets, preview opps and whatnot into a much shorter time-frame, the idea is to just not let media or gamers forget about your product."

Evolve PR's approach seems to be born out of necessity more than anything. In a market full to the brim with shooters, sequelitis and the yearly end-of-year-AAA-saturation - I'm talking about Batman Arkham Asylum, Battlefield 3, Uncharted 3, Modern Warfare 3, Skyrim, Halo Anniversary, a new Need for Speed, Saints Row 3 <em>and</em> Assassin's Creed Revelations all being released within less than 30 days of one another in October/November - it's hard for a new franchise to stand out. So far all we've seen of Hard Reset is a 30 second teaser and a few violently colorful screenshots depicting a noir-inspired city-scapes, which isn't much, but they've got two months to make us start caring.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fear.

If you've ever played a horror game or watched a scary  movie, you should be familiar with fear. That genre of media uses fear  to stir the observer -- in this case, the player -- and it proves to be a  strong emotion which is carried by the audience through the entirety of  the game. Where does that fear <em>come</em> from? Sure, we all know the things that are scary: dark hallways,  terrifying creatures, the general unknown. But what ties them together;  what causes them to create fear in the player? There is one primary  thing that is universal in all of these instances: the weakness that  every player is meant to feel.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-8247" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/the-lion-the-lamb-and-the-fear-of-weakness-8245/amnesia4/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8247" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Amnesia4.jpg" alt="" width="592" height="333" /></a>
Though weakness is a common aspect of games, it seems its effectiveness is multiplied tenfold in horror games. Fear comes from weakness. People are scared of the dark <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uuutica.org%2Flight.htm" target="_blank">because they lose their ability to perceive what is happening around them</a>.  People are scared of the unknown because they don't know how to defend  themselves against it. People are scared of gore because it indicates  what could happen to them. Though it's not outright and obvious, these  things make a player feel weak. That is the ultimate feeling that fear  feeds off of.  Without implementing <em>some</em> form of weakness, it is nearly impossible to scare a viewer.

At  first glance, this is an ambitious claim, but take a look at any horror  game you can think of. For this article, I'll be using Amnesia: The  Dark Descent. In Amnesia, Daniel -- the main character -- must battle  his own insanity along with the horrific creatures he encounters in  order to complete his journey. The game emphasizes the element of the  unknown; the only things the main character knows are his name, where  he's from, there's someone he's supposed to kill, and that there is  something horrifying confronting him. Amnesia is an excellent portrayal  of why weakness creates fear. You know nothing, you know no one, and you  have <em>no way of defending yourself</em>. Whenever you are faced with an enemy, your only option is to run, hide, and pray to your deity of choice that they don't find you, squish you up, and smear you all over the walls like jam on toast.
<br>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-8246" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/the-lion-the-lamb-and-the-fear-of-weakness-8245/amnesia3/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8246" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Amnesia3.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="410" /></a>
Besides  the story elements, the atmosphere of Amnesia also draws upon the  player's weaknesses. The constant near-darkness lessens the player's  ability to see. And with such a valuable sense weakened, the player has  less to work with and has a harder time noticing all the details in  their environment. Uniquely, the longer you are in the darkness, the  more scared Daniel gets, and the more he begins to question his sanity.  Witnessing something horrific drains your sanity even faster, making it  so that you can't even look at your enemies for an extended period of  time. In order to regain your sanity, you must either stand in the  light, or progress further in the game. You can light candles, torches,  or your lantern to keep your wits... but doing so makes you easier to  detect.. Throughout the game you can feel Daniel's tension and fear  through his desperate cries, blurred vision, and heavy breathing. They  are constant reminders that he is just a normal person in a horrible  situation, and he is just as helpless as you or I would be.


<em>Every one</em> of these things adds to the weakness that the player is meant to feel.  And<a rel="attachment wp-att-8249" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/the-lion-the-lamb-and-the-fear-of-weakness-8245/scarecrow/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8249" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Scarecrow.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="319" /></a> these feelings, when stacked up, create fear that can be taken  advantage of to scare the player. Whereas scares are the leaves and fear  is the stem, weakness is the root from which it all draws its energy.  The developers essentially put on their <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FScarecrow_%2528comics%2529" target="_blank">Scarecrow</a> masks  when making horror games; subjecting the players to things that they  fear, feeding off of their reactions, and then throwing it back at them.  Exploitation of phobias, selective insecurity and personal experiences  all draw upon a player's weaknesses, even though they may not realize  it.

In other genres, weakness is something that is used to make a  player feel like they can overcome or are overcoming the impossible. In  horror, it serves as the opposite. As an old Roman proverb states: "it  is better to live one day as a lion, than a thousand days as a lamb."  The lion is the predator, and the lamb is the prey. Most games put you  in the role of the lion. You may be made weak by the odds against you,  but you always come out feeling stronger because of it. True horror puts  you in the role of the lamb. You have those same odds against you  (sometimes even worse), but you know you are weak. You feel you are  weak, and sometimes you wish that you weren't weak. But that's all part  of the adventure.

So, ask yourself: Which role do you prefer? The lion? Or the lamb?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Battlefield 3 developers DICE are talking a pretty big game this year. Along with a legion of players fed up with Call of Duty's popularity, they're hoping they can knock Activision's best-selling franchise from its perch as the be-all-and-end-all of games. While replacing one military shooter backed by a goliath publisher with ... another military shooter backed by a goliath publisher won't really change things, at least DICE are making some interesting promises about the capacity of their new engine, Frosbite 2.0. Lead multiplayer designer Lars Gustavsson spoke to PSM3 magazine about the improved engine and hints at the possibility of <em>earthquakes</em>.

"It's technically possible to have earthquakes in multi-player using Frostbite 2.0. We feel like kids walking into sweet shops with Frostbite - it has so many features we never knew we needed, and we're still figuring out how best to use them," said Gustavsson. "We're still looking into ambient destruction in multi-player; it's still too early to say really."

While not exactly a promise, it's a neat idea - lord knows I'd love to feel Mother Nature herself <em>tremble </em>at the strength of my mortar strikes.

Remember the good old days when you could count on camping out for a new console at least once every five years?  Those days may be gone.  In a recent interview with James Brightman at industrygamers.com, EA CEO John Riccitiello declared the old console cycle dead and if you read his statements below, it appears that if given the opportunity, Mr. EA would be happy to personally deliver the final nail to that coffin.
<blockquote>"I would argue that one of the least interesting things about the games industry was that every five years you'd see a new console or platform from everybody at about the same time with about the same or similar upgrades or services...But it's not a particularly smart way to run an industry...bulges in technology investment followed by harvest.  And let's be realistic.  Consoles used to be 80% of the industry as recently as 2000.  Consoles today are 40% of the game industry..."</blockquote>
He used those startling statistics as a lead-in to his defense of Nintendo:
<blockquote>"So I think that the pattern against which Nintendo is no longer resonating is over anyway.  The idea that we're going to see the need for step function growth in graphic performance as the pace setting aspect of the sector is no longer the most important thing...Our fastest growing platform is the iPad right now and that didn't exist 18 months ago.  So the idea that we're categorizing the industry as being [cyclical].  Nintendo is off cycle with what?  I mean, the point of reference is gone."</blockquote>
Riccitiello also claimed that the uncanny valley is a thing of the past and that the difference between 720p and 1080p is nearly negligible.  While not blazing a new path as Sony has been touting a 10 year life cycle as far back as the PS2, the statement regarding consoles current place in the gaming market goes further to reinforce his company's billion dollar acquisition of PopCap as EA attempts to gain a stronger foothold in the growing casual market, specifically the iPad. 

So what say you, Nightmare Mode reader?  Are you in a hurry to see next-gen consoles?  Or is Riccitiello attempting the sway the market to stay as is for as long as possible in order for EA to see a substantial return on its PopCap purchase?  Share your opinion in the comments below!  Also, you can also read the interview in its entirety <a href="http://www.industrygamers.com/news/ea-ceo-consoles-now-only-40-of-games-industry/" target="_blank">here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Developer Touches On Why the WiiWare Distribution Platform Sucks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wiiware.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8298" title="wiiware" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wiiware.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="174" /></a>It seems that the console business isn't kind to small indie developers. If Cthulu Saves The World on XBL wasn't an indication of this fact, then here's some more evidence for you. <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RichardHillWhittall/20110718/8004/Icons_WiiWare_Development__Post_Mortem.php">In a post-mortem</a>, Richard Hill-Whittall of Icon Entertainment, a Wiiware developer, spoke about the conditions under which Wiiware titles are expected to sell.

He calls the store "horribly inflexible" given that "you can't change the price point, they don't run sales or promotions, you can't update the game once it is on sale unless there is a critical bug found, etc." Y'know, all the features available to developers in a platform like Steam? All the options available to developers on Steam which have proven to boost sales and keep a happy, engaged audience? "In short WiiWare prohibits you from trying any of the usual approaches you can (use) to kick-start sales."

Aside from this, the way in which developers get paid is also problematic. Nintendo has a system of thresholds where in order to receive <em>any </em>profit, a developer must sell X number of copies in a two year span first. This means that some developers may release titles on the platform and have to wait more than a year to actually see any profits--even if their title is selling. If it's not selling, developers can't do anything to bolster sales because of the aforementioned conditions, as they cannot change price points or run promotions. It's entirely possible to not hit a threshold and not see any payment despite all the work a developer may have put into the title and despite <em>some </em>sales.

It's strange that even with digital distribution, a platform that is typically a boon for smaller, lesser known developers, Nintendo still propagates a system where only triple A or first party titles have a legitimate chance to succeed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Last May, Luke Plunkett over at Kotaku had <a title="The Forgotten Art of the Video Game Title Screen" href="http://kotaku.com/5806836/the-forgotten-art-of-the-video-game-title-screen/gallery/1">this</a> to say regarding the "forgotten art" of title screens:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Featuring big artwork and even bigger titles, it had to capture  everything the game stood for. Everything it was about. Everything it  was trying to sell to you, the consumer.</em></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>These days, of course, they're less important. They're usually just the  things you end up on if you leave a controller idle, or are an obstacle  you have to mash a button to get past in order to actually start playing.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wonder, have  we lost the meaning of the title screen? Who knew that was even  possibleâ€¦? The title screen, on a deep structural level, represents the  threshold between our world and the gameworld. It can't just simply stop  <em>meaning</em>, can it? And if so, what could have caused such a fracture? Boredom? Apathy?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'll  tell you what I think. I think the title screen is every bit as  striking today as it was thirty years ago. We've just never really  understood it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take these two, for instanceâ€¦</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/StarForceChampLodeTwofer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7952" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/StarForceChampLodeTwofer.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="262" /></a>â€¦<em>Star Force</em> and <em>Championship Lode Runner</em>.  The first, a celebrated work of overhead shootery. The second, a  highly-revered thinking man's arcade game, and the first game to ship  with user-created content. But what do the two games have in <em>common?</em> Well, for one, both were ported to the Nintendo Famicom in 1985.  Additionally, both were published by Hudson Soft (an early licensee of  the Quality-Crusading Nintendo). Ah but let us not lose the trees in the  forest...</p>

<div><a rel="attachment wp-att-8203" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/this-too-shall-push-a-history-of-starting-8049/starforcechamplodestarter/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8203" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/StarForceChampLodeStarter.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="118" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">â€¦Both  games, as it turns out, were the firsts to feature the "Push Start"  prompt (it's worth noting here that I deliberately chose not to include  dB-Soft's <em>Flappy</em>, which actually released in the two months that separated <em>CLR</em> and <em>SF</em>,  and which prompted the player to Push Select, a small but significant  difference), a "feature" that has today become so ingrained in the  substructure of gaming that I was actually taken aback upon realizing  that it hadn't <em>just always been that way</em>. So<em>â€”</em>as I do<em>â€”</em>I got to the bottom of it...</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">...In  the era before the steely grip of the home market (which is to mean,  pre-NES), the purpose of a title screen was one of a singular purpose:  to attract the eyes (and quarters) of would-be players, players with  myriad other choices flashing all around them. Developers, realizing the  potential for advertising rhetoric, quickly pulled out all the stops:  simply passing by a game became a kind of Grand Tour...gamers were  treated to flashy title screens, cut-scenes, high scores, demos...One  never-released prototype used an on-board camera to capture the faces of  high-score winners and display them to all that passed by (for those  wondering why this prototype never saw production, I ask you to consider  the first thing you think of when you consider logging back onto  Chatroulette)...But none of these tactics, in the eyes of the developer  at least, were as important as that often-subdued, but always-present  prompt: Insert Coin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If  we agree that games are an "experience" (that our playing is more profound than "Hey, I did a thing"),  then this prompt luring the player inward, this "Insert Coin," is no less than  an official Contract of Experience: you pay, you play. There were no  other stipulations, outside of time and space, at least...just this  fundamental agreement. What's more, this contract was to decide many of  the gaming conventions that were to persist far beyond the initial  structure of the arcade itself...the life and score counters; the  ridiculous difficulty; temporary power-ups; game length. This one prompt  came to inform nearly every aspect of a game's mechanics and  presentation. Ever-present in those early years, "Insert Coin" would  long define the experience of games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In  much the same way, the arcade game defined, for a while, the home  market. Most of the games released on the various systems of the early  1980s were little more than (often vastly inferior) ports of arcade  games; consequently, developers who were working exclusively with the home  market had few paradigms to choose from. Thus games that were not first  in the arcade were still very arcade-y in design (though change was  surely coming). The problem of course was that there was one aspect of  arcade games that couldn't be ported over: the need to insert quarters.  Suddenly, developers were without their "contract." The exchange of money now took place <em>outside</em> of playing. Console developers faced a task finding another way to make the actual starting  meaningful. And so  "experience" entered into a transitory period: the Options Era...the  Game A or B: One Player or Two Player; Level 1/2/3 Era.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The  problem was one that home market developers recognized instantly, I'm  sure: console games, since they've already been bought and paid for, <em>still</em> needed a contract...a waiting space for gamers to sit back and prepare  themselves before beginning...a purgatory between  powered-on-but-not-yet-playing and <em>actually playing</em>.  And while the options screen worked for arcade-y games, what about  those that were trying to be something else? For those developers, they  would have to just make due with the clumsy-sounding and meaningless  "Press A" Experience.</p>
And then came Nintendo.
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Start-Button.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7773" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Start-Button.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="168" /></a>Debuting  in 1983, the Famicom controller, which for many years and through many  iterations would come to define the norm, happened to include a button  more conducive to "a beginning" than "Press A"...<em>the Start button.</em> Though first appearing on the Atari 5200 in 1982, Nintendo's Start button wasn't just<em> one more button among twelve</em>. It was an aesthetic choice, one that struck a brilliant balance between the  single-button console systems and the multitude of "buttons" (keys) that  PC keyboards offered. Even the name of their console implied a fusion  of these two ideals: the FAMICOM, or FAMIly COMputer, attempted to find a  middle-ground in which to both re-invigorate the home console market  and to challenge the PC game market. These two previously exclusionary  conceptions of "experience" (the arcade-informed and the PC game)  gradually begin to intertwine: arcade developers began to make broader,  more exploration based games; PC developers began to simplify their  (often) convoluted control choices. Without a doubt, the majority of  games today are informed by this same conceit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And  let us not lose track of history here: Push Start very likely evolved  directly from PC games. The Press Any Key prompt, appearing both in  and out of games since the 1970s, had been a staple of experience  beginning long before 1985. And I can't imagine that this wasn't an  influence on console games; those in a prove it mood might notice that  the very first Push Start prompt (<em>Championship Lode Runner</em>) came from a PC developer (BrÃ¸derbund). And yet, I am not arguing that the PC <em>invented</em> the  Push Start prompt...not alone, at least. Press Any Key, while  objectively performing the same function of Push Start, is  subjectively a different animal. For one, we are missing that all  important word, Start, a word that implies beginning and promises  experience. For two, Press Any Key didn't evolve <em>in gaming</em>...the  prompt had already been firmly established in the PC world, and thus  any experience it (as a prompt) connoted was the same experience that a  word processor or calculator connoted. Finally, PC gaming, especially  during the era of DOS prompts, was a long, often-complicated <em>thread</em> of  startings...even before a game could be booted there were other  commands to be entered, on top of powering on the computer and inserting  the disk...By the time PC gamers began they'd been beginning for  several minutes already.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which  is all to say the obvious: PC gaming is just different (we'll say was  different, but only because is different would take us astray from  the point). Different expectations; different experience. Despite its  distant origins in PC gaming, the future of Press Start rested in the  hands of arcade developers transitioning into a new era; developers who  were, at the same time, treading carefully between the Arcade and the PC  game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tower-of-Druaga.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7772" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tower-of-Druaga.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="216" /></a>...In late 1985, Namco published three games that's title screens seemed to epitomize this transition. First up is <em>Druaga No Tou</em> (<em>The Tower of Druaga</em>), which presented players with the option to either Start or Continue. Like <em>Star Force</em> before it, <em>Druaga No Tou</em> was an arcade port; unlike <em>Star Force</em>, players choosing to play <em>Druaga No Tou</em> at home were given the additional benefit of <em>Continuing</em>.  The game itself wasn't longer or noticeably more difficult...and I  can't imagine that the use of Continue here made the game all that  different to play. But viewing this title screen is to see adaptation in  action...to see developers testing the landscape that the home  experience had to offer, looking for footholds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Pac-Land-J.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7784" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Pac-Land-J.png" alt="" width="256" height="240" /></a>That November, <em>Pac-Land</em> added  a bit of a cinematic flair to the whole proceeding, scrolling its Push  Start prompt into view. Though this flair came at a cost: despite  the fact that <em>Pac-Land</em> was, like <em>Star Force</em> and <em>Druaga No Tau</em> before  it, a port of an arcade game, the experimental step of Continuing  taken by Namco just a few months previous is completely missing here.</p>

And in what way did it appear? As a part of <em>Nintendo's Vs. Arcade</em><em>â€”</em>a platform designed specifically to begin bringing console games to the arcade. <em>Versus arcade?</em> If we were looking for the breaking point, this would be it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To Start Push? Eh, close enough.</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From  the lover's goodbye to the stranger's bedroom; from the rush of the  subway platform to the stifling city street; to be human is to be  always, all the time, coming from somewhere. Yet are our lives but  chronology, but individual points along linear time? Or might there be a  deeper substructure to our experience of the world; threaded through  moments, crossing and circling back, entangling and distorting any  objective conception of Time?</p>
And I only ask because we've come to that point now...we're looking for the big one; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> Push Start prompt; the one we'll point at, say, Right there, that's where it started...
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Legend-of-Zelda-The-E.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7833" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Legend-of-Zelda-The-E.png" alt="" width="256" height="240" /></a>Right here, for instance. At seven, this legendary title screen was the first time I'd  ever seen a Push Start prompt. I imagine this is probably true of many  from my generation, that generation who grew up alongside the rise of  console games. In terms of the transition of experience, there was no  console game previous that offered what this offered, and it did so with  Push Start in place. <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> represents not only one of the first great achievements of the home market, but a monumental moment in <em>experience</em> itself.  For me, there are few more palpable symbols of mid-eighties,  pre-globalization, Self-Esteem Movement-infused America: a becoming-of  tale...a hero, divined by his very bloodline, by his True claim to the  world, setting out to repair a world unable of repairing itself.</p>

Ah but here come the nay-sayers:
<p style="text-align: justify;">...You've misread History, old bean! For you <em>Americans</em> the first major â€˜Push Start' was <em>the Legend of Zelda</em>...ah but that was 1987! The original Japanese release of the game in 1986 had been on the Famicom Disk System, and unlike your <em>American</em> counterpart, had been sans â€˜Push Start!' You arrogant fool, we wouldn't get a â€˜Push Start'-ed <em>Zelda</em> until 1991! So what say you now, now that your Great Beginning of Experience has been exposed as a fraud?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We  live a history uncapturable by timelines. Try as we might to adhere to  objective reality, our experience of the world is more akin to those  pesky wiggle-worms in the eye: not only a matter of perspective but a  matter of constant, fluid change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In  interrogating the title screen<em>â€”</em>our search for its purpose and  meaning<em>â€”</em>we must ask ourselves, what does Push Start actually mean?  For that matter, what does starting even mean? Where exactly in the  life-long flush of experience do we say, Here. Here's where it  happened, where one thing ended and another thing began? If our  subjective experience is ever-tangled in and around and through itself,  what marks change?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consider this Narrative of Thumbs we call gaming. When did I begin <em>Mass Effect</em>,  for instance? Was it in my cracking open the case to inspect its manual  ? Or was it my handing over of cold hard cash? And what about next  year's <em>Mass Effect 3?</em> Won't Push Start have a dual meaning there, as I won't be beginning  my journey so much as concluding it? I'll be concluding the story of the  character I have shaped over the course of the previous two games. And  yet, I am starting somethingâ€¦I'm starting the conclusion. So how might I classify the experience of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> then?  Did the game begin the first time I watched a preview, knowing  beforehand that I would<em>â€”</em>as I always do<em>â€”</em>play the straight-laced hero?  And what will inform my experience, my preferred style of play  throughout the previous two games, or my memory of a few poor choices in  <em>Mass Effect 2?</em> The first would be a continuity of self, the second a continuity of circumstance. Which Shepard are you, Shepard? Which me am I?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's take it further back, to a place applicable to less interconnected games: Who's to say that <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, though it was nearly twenty-five years away, didn't begin with my first time reading Isaac Asimov's <em>Robot Series</em>,  my first foray into science fiction? Though the game would eventually  exist despite my reading or not reading the only science fiction series  that has really, truly interested me, I wouldn't have really noticed it,  just as I hardly noticed <em>Jade Empire</em><em>â€”</em>a game which, until this moment, more or less in my mind did not exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So  perhaps it was Asimov. But let's not forget that it was my father's  interest in Asimov that fostered my own, my father whose image was my  model for manhood. Does the beginning of <em>Mass Effect</em> really stretch that far back? If so, can it go further?</p>

[caption id="attachment_8312" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Mitsurugi wants to stab your character"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8312" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/i-can-has-create-my-own-soul-calibur-5-character-8307/soul-calibur-4-mitsurugi_a/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8312" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/soul-calibur-4-mitsurugi_a-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

Thanks to the "NPC Recruiting Initiative" currently enabled on soularchive.jp, you can finally stop arguing about why a fetus ninja would dominate Ivy.   Simply provide a name for your dream character as well as a fighting style and appearance preference and you could possibly sway Namco Bandai to include your original character in Soul Calibur V!!! 

You have until August 5 to submit your entry, so use that time to think wisely.  What weapon would your character wield?  What unnatural hair color would your character have?  If female, will her breasts be ridiculously large or far too ridiculously large?  Well, perhaps you don't have that sort of complete control.  You will be able to select a nationality and then be asked to answer a selection of multiple choice questions. 

Regardless, don't miss this opportunity to be a part of gaming history.  And if you take the above breast comment literally, don't miss your opportunity to give young girls everywhere "Soul Crippling" body issues.  I mean really...has our society not evolved enough to accept a female fighting game character with a B-cup?  Is that too much to ask?  Perhaps you can make it so, Nightmare Mode reader!

Follow this <a href="http://www.soularchive.jp/npc_recruiting/" target="_blank">link</a> and give it your best!  And while you're at it, let us know what your ideal character would be in the comments below!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Speaking at this year's Develop Conference in Brighton, EA executive Roger Walkden advised indie developers against self-publishing, instead them to pursue deals with mobile and Facebook publishers.

"Two, three or four years ago there was a lot of buzz about self-publishing," said Walkden, who heads up business development at EA Partners. Since then, what's happened is developers have realized that when they have to do self-publishing, they actually have to do publishing, which is harder than it looks.

Walkden added that success is still possible through self-publishing, but developers often underestimate the full scope of marketing, localization and distribution.

Xbox Live Arcade portfolio director Chris Charla concurred with Walkden, suggesting developers stick to developing.

If you want to be a great developer, you don't want to think about publishing. With freedom comes more of a responsibility to decide where to go.

		<title>R18+ rating for Australia draws one step closer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After years of delays, disagreements and political circle-jerking, all signs point to Australia <em>finally</em> revamping its classification system and introducing an R18+ rating for video games. Australia's classification body, the Office of Film and Literature Classification, has long trailed the developed world in its ratings system, which has seen games like <em>Dead Rising</em> under-classified as M15+, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> heavily censored and the most recent <em>Mortal Kombat</em> outright refused classification - and thus refused distribution.

At a meeting of the country's Attorneys-General, eight agreed in principle to go forward with an R18+ rating, with the only holdout being New South Wales Attorney General Greg Smith, who is waiting on advice from the Australian Law Review Commission before proceeding. However, the Commonwealth may opt to proceed regardless of NSW's position.

Speaking to <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/07/brendan-oconnor-and-r18-im-relieved-its-over/">Kotaku Australia</a>, Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor expressed confidence that Smith is likely to agree with the other Attorneys-General.

[New South Wales] didn't say no, they actually said they didn't want to be the odd one out, so that sound positive considering the eight other states agreed in principle.

And the reason it says â€˜in principle' is that there are some amendments that have to be made, and that's just a matter of the Attorneys-General taking these amendments back to their cabinets and approving it."

O'Connor, who has been a long-time proponent for the rating, expressed relief that the saga was nearly over. The decision also comes as a relief to the 42,000  gamers - including myself - who supported the move in a <a href="http://www.ebgames.com.au/news-728-The-time-to-be-heard-is-now-EB-Games-launches-R18-Classification-Petition">petition</a> conducted by EB Games in February of last year.

The issue has long been on the table for Australia's Attorneys-General, but experienced a number of setbacks, particularly from former South Australian Attorney General Michael Atkinson, who was against the rating. The Australian Christian Lobby also vehemently opposed the decision, fearing it would lead to an influx of violent media that could be harmful to children, despite the fact that under the current classification system, several games have received more lenient ratings in Australia than they have in the rest of the world.

The new rating will most likely be in place by the end of the year. However, games refused classification in the past will not be re-classified under the new law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of writer Kurt Vonnegut's rules for writing engaging fiction was thus: Write to please just one person.  If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.

He had a second rule: Start as close to the end as possible.  <em>Avadon: The Black Fortress </em>follows neither of these rules, and it feels like a sick, bloated title.  It's quite <strong>good</strong>, too, in spite of itself.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_1.jpg" alt="" title="Avadon_1" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8475" /></a>

Spiderweb Software have been around for seventeen years at this point as the project of one man, Jeff Vogel.  He's notable, additionally, for his blog, where he talks about things like how indie games are too cheap, how piracy is bad, and why game developers shouldn't listen to forums users.  All good ideas.  He's been around for a long time, and Spiderweb has been making games since I started playing then.  Exile, that shareware great, was one of the first games I played as an impressionable youth.  The <em>Avernum </em>and <em>Geneforge </em>series are excellent examples of retro RPGs set in evocative fantasy worlds, and they provide all the meat and potatoes that fans of classic series such as <em>Baldur's Gate </em>require.

So now we have <em>Avadon: The Black Fortress</em>, the first entry in a new series.  Compared to Spiderweb's previous games its tone is much darker, its world more a bleak fantasy than anything else.  You are an agent of an autocratic, bureaucratic government that doesn't seem to be helping its people very much, and you're assigned tasks to help that government's operations in a varied, complicated fantasy world.

Well, that's what it offers.  In reality, it takes a long time for the world of Avadon to reveal itself to you.  It's where Spiderweb's financial aversion to fancy graphics really comes back to haunt them.  Video games, in general, can be good at giving us worldbuilding through osmosis, in the sense that we walk through the cities and towns of the world we're spending hours in.  RPGs like <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Planescape</em>, and (gasp) <em>Dragon Age </em>succeed at doing this without a second though.  Ferelden feels alive because we can walk through it and talk to its people.  Spiderweb's previous titles succeeded in this regard by having premises, either crashing on an island or being thrown down into a pit, that served to quickly immerse the player in the setting.  You were thrown into the creek, and you were told to take the world in.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_map.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_map.jpg" alt="" title="Avadon_map" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8476" /></a>

<em>Avadon </em>has none of that.  Frankly, saying the beginning of the game is abysmal might be being too kind.  Provided a massive, richly imagined (trust me on this one) world full of political intrigue, interesting places, and intense people, you're thrown into the dungeon of a keep filled with rats, goblins, and the most uninteresting people imaginable.  Everyone treats you like a gofer, someone they're trusting to kill rats because you have no intrinsic value.  Then they send you to kill some goblin analogues bothering a dragon in a backwater village that has absolutely no personality.

All of this is realisticâ€”there's no way a secretive, bureaucratic government would be nice to a new employee, and there's no way they'd trust you with important tasksâ€”but this does not make a fun game.  Instead of using this opportunity to engage you with one of the more interesting and complicated fantasy worlds around, Avadon gives you busywork and removes any scrap of personality from the world until you get through hours and hours of game.

I'm a notable opponent of liking games because they get better, and while <em>Avadon </em>does get significantly better this opening is practically inexcusable.  Its goal is Baldurian in its scope: set you to busywork so you get a sense of the government you're working for (parallel to <em>Baldur's </em>sending you on busywork so you understand the economic realities of the Sword Coast), but this is hardly compelling.  When you have a government that lets giant rats break into their prison and eat people, I get the impression the government is awful.  It feels like a conscious effort to slow the pace from titles like <em>Geneforge</em>, which started with you stranded, alone, on an island surrounded by your people's fantastic technology so that everyone could really fall into the fantasy.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_2.jpg" alt="" title="Avadon_2" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8477" /></a>

That's <em>Avadon</em>'s big problem.  It's opened up the window and tried to make love to the world.  Spiderweb's previous games were for the hardest of the hardcore, the kind of people who wrote long, involved articles about classic CRPGs and expected people to care.  <em>Avadon </em>tries to be for them, but it also tries to streamline everything into a package consumable by the average idiot.  You can't really mess up your character build, because there are four classes with very easily defined skills (as opposed to <em>Geneforge</em>'s brilliant system); I don't see this so much as a negative, but it's another sign of this drive towards accessibility.  Instead of complicated fantasy worlds, we have one where the status quo can be figured out quickly and none of the details are needed for a long while.  Instead of making a party or having only your summons as your guides, you instead have additional characters you can choose from who have personalities and defined existences.

It's not necessarily a dumbing down, but it is a change.  It's a change that brought pneumonia with it.  The game, as a whole, isn't particularly hard on normal*, and the high ratio of encounters with no possible challenge to the player, coupled with a slow turn based system, really serves to distract from its strong points.  On the normal difficulty you will be occasionally challenged by difficult fights but all too often you will be slogging through waste-high groups of enemies who can't damage your party.  You'll be clicking through a slow, not particularly smooth combat system until the obstacles, more akin to knee high hurdles instead of goblin analogues and snakes, are gone for good.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_3.jpg" alt="" title="Avadon_3" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8478" /></a>

It's not all bad with <em>Avadon</em>, though.  You see, somewhere in my fifth or sixth hour with the game, somewhere around the time when I found a comically small looking dragon in a cave, I fell for <em>Avadon</em>.  It was like falling in love with someone who has no distinguishing features, for absolutely no reason, but I resolved that I liked the game.  I think the moment that got me was the Dragon's personal assistant.  It's the kind of moment that makes <em>Avadon </em>just work as a game.  All the struggles, all the tribulations, they all mean bupkiss when you finally meet a character who's memorable.  The Dragon's PA, for reference, is a weak, shrimpy lady who stands up to the dragon and is downright unpleasant to him because she knows she has job security.  It's the kind of idea that's never really been touched on in the fantasy worldâ€”hey, it's someone who's legitimately employed in this land of adventurers and autocratic government agentsâ€”and it's an idea that shows you that deep down <em>Avadon </em>has some brilliant ideas.

<em>Avadon</em>'s that girl in a romantic comedy who's funny, basically.  She's not much to look at, but she's funny, and she makes you feel like you exist in a better world, one where RPGs are more <em>Baldur's Gate </em>than <em>Dragon Age 2.  </em>A world where we're playing turn based games because we want to play them, not because the developers aren't talented enough to make a first person shooter.  A better world. 

<em>Avadon</em>'s strongest card is its choices.  In a world where all choices are placed on a linear scale, where every player is told, You are good or evil! <em>Avadon </em>presents a world with intense grayness.  Quests don't always work out in your favor if you perform the action.  You can make mistakes, and these mistakes can cost you both valuable experience and the respect of your peers.  Not to sound like a broken record, but I wish the game were better presented because it offers a really, truly brilliant array of choices in situations; instead of a lawful good-chaotic evil binary, it instead offs a lawful neutral-chaotic neutral one which provides for a lot more gray and more interesting options than anything on the market.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_4.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Avadon_4.jpg" alt="" title="Avadon_4" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8479" /></a>

If you love choices, then <em>Avadon </em>might be the game for you.  You should give it a chance, fight with it, because it'll show you a world where your choices matter.  And you will find it good.

It's hard to tell anyone else to give <em>Avadon </em>a chance because for the first five hours it's going to try to fight you at every turn.  It's going to alienate you.  Anyone who wants to like it because they like Jeff Vogel's games has already heard of it and has already plunked down the cash for it.  Anyone who's never heard of him is probably, paradoxically, better off starting somewhere else, somewhere more vibrant and brilliant if less immediately accessible.  It's a shame, because <em>Avadon </em>has some really great ideas underneath its horrible introduction; most gamers, alas, will never see them.  


*This point has been contentious on message boards and Jeff Vogel's blog.  His point, in effect, is that veteran players should be starting on hard, while new players can take normal.  Personally, I see this as a cop out.  There's an easy mode designed to just experience the story.  New players will pick that.  Veterans grew up in a world where picking hard was something you do on future playthroughs, where normal is the option on playthrough one, and I don't see why this game needs to reinvent a working difficulty paradigm. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/review-outland-6567/">Remember my <em>Outland </em>review?</a>  Of course you don't.  But everything I say there goes triple for <em>Bastion</em>.  In a year of pretty incredible independent games, <em>Bastion </em>is the <strong>best of the year </strong>so far.  It is a legitimately <strong>great game </strong>and <strong>you have to play it</strong>.

That's the hook.  Now back to the beginning.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_1.jpg" alt="" title="Bastion_1" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8486" /></a>

<em>"Proper story's supposed to start at the beginning.  Ain't so simple with this one."</em>

We know about <em>Bastion </em>for one reason: its overwhelming sense of style.  Usually, though, style in a video game is like a guy wearing a suit covered in shiny, reflective panels: eye catching but ultimately hollow.  Even <em>Outland</em>, a game I will compare to <em>Bastion </em>relentlessly, had a hollow style, a beautiful face that would have grown tiresome if not for quality gameplay.  <em>Bastion</em>, on the other hand, comes at you like an immaculated groomed man wearing a smoking jacket, puffing on a cigarillo, reading Tolstoy and asking to put classical music on the record player that's materialized next to you.  It is style personified.  <em>Bastion</em>'s style punches you in the face and asserts itself from the get go.

A lot of this comes from the narrator.  He's as good as advertised.  If you try really hard you could get him to repeat things, but the man never repeated a single line of dialog while I was playing, which I consider a huge feat.  He's fantastically realized.  His comments aren't so much description of what you're doing but rather a second voice that serves to create the world around you.  The narrator uses the most pleasing baritone since Ron Perlman to provide back story, interesting tidbits, and help inform you of how to defeat the toughest enemies.

And enemies there are.  The game itself plays like an action/RPG, reminiscent of <em>Diablo </em>but truly specialized to work on consoles.  It's not a click-a-thon, but rather a smart game where you have to focus on balancing dodging and countering to keep the enemies off balance.  In general you will end up attacking and rolling out of the way a lot, which is very satisfying.  Furthermore, it's chock full of RPG elements.  Before each level you can pick two of the games ten or so weapons, all of which are pretty viable until the end.  They're viable because each weapon features a fairly meaty upgrade path, and each upgrade has two different ways it can go, allowing you to specialize each weapon pretty dramatically.  You can also drink spirits before you go into a level, which makes the Kid even stronger and more durable.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_2.jpg" alt="" title="Bastion_2" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8487" /></a>

The Kid, by the way, isn't really a kid.  The Kid is plastered with all sorts of plot elements that serve to make him a memorable badass protagonist.  

This is where <em>Bastion </em>shines the brightest.  The humble action/RPG has never been a place for story.  <em>Diablo 2</em>, patron saint of the genre, had a yarn best described as throwaway.  In a genre with dozens of games, there has never been one with a story worth hearing.  And yet here comes Bastion, proving all the naysayers wrong with an utterly compelling yarn with well-rounded characters comparable to a tripe A experience.

Admittedly, the title gets a lot of its narrative from atmosphere.  The world <em>Bastion </em>places you in is immediately compelling, and it follows up on that by offering up the best writing in a video game.

Here's a moment that sums <em>Bastion</em>'s writing up.  This paragraph will have spoilers, so if you don't like having the first ten minutes of a game spoiled, look away.  One of the strongest moments Bastion has is this one.  In the beginning of the game, after running through a destroyed, fragmented world, you end up in a saloon, a place where The Kid had frequented.  The narrator tells you about the bartender, his name, his interests, the Kid's experiences with him.  You fight off some enemies (actually, his security system).  Then you look up, towards a balcony above the fray, and you see him.  You see him, except his body has been reduced to ash.  He's looking at you.  You can see his face.  You can see his eyes.  And, in good action/rpg, fashion, you smash him to bits with your hammer.  The narrator says, roughly, Barkeep always wanted to have his ashes scattered here.  The Kid did him the honor.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_3.jpg" alt="" title="Bastion_3" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8488" /></a>

That's the kind of moment <em>Bastion </em>thrives off of.  It's a game about human moments.  It's a game about relating to the characters you meet, about relating to the world.  It's not so much a game about plot as it is a game about story.  One could describe it as a game about rebuilding a world, but it would be more accurate to say it is about reliving, about imagining a world that is now gone, a world you are trying to restore, but one that you cannot restore.  It's not about what is happening, but about what has happened.

Fundamentally, it is a game about loss.  It's a game about might have beens as much as it is about plot.  It sets things up, and it lets your imagination take hold to fill out different elements of the narrative which you could care about.  And then, eventually, it comes to a very deliberate conclusion.  It's a complete, deliberate game.

And it plays that way in the trenches.  It is not a gleeful whack-a-thon, but rather a terse, deliberate game of combat in close, confined quarters.  You have to think about your dodges, your counters, your recoils.  Your actions must be deliberate and careful.  You have to think about the choices you make, both in combat and in preparation.  It is a thoughtful and deliberate game whose pace matches the story, and the combination produces an intoxicating effect.  It's thoughtful and demanding, punctuated with bursts of violence.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_4.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bastion_4.jpg" alt="" title="Bastion_4" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8489" /></a>

<em>Bastion</em>'s most important element, however, is this one: the ending.  In a world where every video game ends poorly, <em>Bastion </em>caps things off with a spectacular, fitting conclusion for the ages.  I've been reading a number of comparisons to <em>Braid </em>on the internet in the past couple of days, and they feel particularly apt: <em>Braid </em>was, metaphorically, a film by a famous director, Frederico Fellini or the like, that awed and wowed us with its technical achievement.  <em>Bastion</em>, on the other hand, plays like a modern classic, a piece you don't have to be an intellectual to understand.  Its crowning achievement is taking the sense of marvel that Braid created and putting it into the body of work that can touch everyone.  There's no extended metaphor in the game itself, just a solid story beautifully told.

Put simply, <em>Bastion </em>is a game that makes me love playing games.  It is tense, weighty, and tells the kind of story that video games should tell.  It both reminds me of playing classics like <em>Okami </em>while remaining its own incredible thing.  This is all we can ask of our games, and <em>Bastion </em>delivers unquestionably.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sorry it took so long to approve; I've been incommunicado for what feels like days, and Patricia is busy interning for a major site that rhymes with Constructoid.

Thanks for the kind words.  I hadn't thought about it, but Planescape and Bastion are eminently comparable.  Neither kills it on gameplay, but both tell their stories similarly: they both have a main plot, but they both give just as much attention to the issues on the sides.  The people feel real, as a result, and the story feels weighty.

(As opposed to Catherine, but that's a future show.)

I don't know that Bastion is better than Planescape.  I might feel strongly enough to call them 1A and 1B.  Bastion has a lot less dissonance between game and narrative, but Planescape tells a more complex tale.  Bastion sets its sights relatively low in terms of scope, throws every trick it can into the pot, has an extremely high quality of writing, and has definitely the most satisfying story since Planescape.

I'm waiting to give Bastion another set of comments once I beat it again, but right now I'm thinking it's definitely up there on the Mount Rushmore of video game narratives with Planescape, Psychonauts, and...either a game I forgot or a game as obscured as Teddy Roosevelt is in the actual one. xD]]></wp:comment_content>

I'm waiting to give Bastion another set of comments once I beat it again, but right now I'm thinking it's definitely up there on the Mount Rushmore of video game narratives with Planescape, Psychonauts, and...either a game I forgot or a game as obscured as Teddy Roosevelt is in the actual one. xD";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:4:"8485";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:4:"2545";s:32:"POST__wp_unfiltered_html_comment";s:10:"11af5f4f2b";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"2537da2318";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:8:"Apache/2";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:11:"SCRIPT_NAME";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:14:"REQUEST_METHOD";s:4:"POST";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:15:"SCRIPT_FILENAME";s:59:"/home/users/web/b36/moo.thekruecom/nmm/wp-comments-post.php";s:11:"REMOTE_PORT";s:5:"41699";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:63:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:17:"GATEWAY_INTERFACE";s:7:"CGI/1.1";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:13:"DOCUMENT_ROOT";s:38:"/home/users/web/b36/moo.thekruecom/nmm";s:11:"REMOTE_HOST";s:34:"c-24-91-29-147.hsd1.ma.comcast.net";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"TjAszgoBDEMAAErU@vcAAAAs";s:11:"SERVER_NAME";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:53:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/review-bastion-8485/";s:12:"SERVER_ADMIN";s:31:"cgiadmin@yourhostingaccount.com";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:13:"gzip, deflate";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:5:"close";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1499";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:11:"SERVER_PORT";s:2:"80";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:11:"REMOTE_ADDR";s:12:"24.91.29.147";s:15:"SERVER_PROTOCOL";s:8:"HTTP/1.0";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:2:"TZ";s:7:"EST5EDT";s:8:"PHP_SELF";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:12:"REQUEST_TIME";s:10:"1311780046";s:4:"argv";s:0:"";s:4:"argc";s:1:"0";}]]></wp:meta_value>

("The world Bastion places you in is immediately compelling, and it follows up on that by offering up the best writing in a video game.")

Did you mean some of the best writing in a video game, or are you going out on a limb and pinning a 'best in show' on this one? High praise considering you said about Planescape ("...if it was, then Planescape: Torment would be revered forever as a shining example of storytelling, because it possesses perhaps the most developed, high quality narrative in video games...")

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's good to know that while Roger Ebert, the state of California and <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/07/sunrise-seamus-and-jim-wallace-of-the-acl-discuss-oslo-and-modern-warfare-2/#comments">conservative lobbyists</a> may question the artistic value of video games, there is a concerted effort to preserve the medium's history. In that spirit, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36101/Microsoft_Donates_Gaming_History_Collection_To_ICHEG.php">Gamasutra reports</a> that Microsoft are the latest organisation to donate to ICHEG, the International Center for the History of Electronic Games. They join recent donors Ralph Baer, creator of the Magnavox Odyssey, SimCity mastermind Will Wright, gaming site 1Up and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, who provided a $100,000 grant in May.

"ICHEG is delighted to collaborate with Microsoft to help preserve the company's gaming history and bring attention to its extraordinary contributions to shaping the world of video games," said ICHEG director Jon-Paul Dyson.

A selection of items from  Microsoft's donation, which includes hardware, software, prototypes, merchandise and promotional material, will be on display at <a href="http://www.icheg.org/see-do">eGame Revolution</a> section of The National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, while the rest of the material will be available for archived for research purposes.

ICHEG's efforts are part of a move to chronicle over 30 years of video game history, an issue <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6271/where_games_go_to_sleep_the_game_.php">Gamasutra covered</a> in January. The Smithsonian are preparing a similar exhibition called <a href="http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/">The Art of Video Games</a>, which will run from March to September in 2012.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the thousands of impressive creations that have been spawned by Minecraft users, do you ever wonder if anything still impresses Notch and the Mojang guys?  Wonder no more.  I give you...Middle Earth.  Not just Hobbiton.  Not just Rivendell.  Middle Earth.  I'm sure even Minecraft's creators have to tip their cap to this.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhksNvUwaRc
Peter Jackson and his brilliant crew at Weta Workshop showed an eye-popping attention to detail when bringing Middle Earth to theaters.  As you will see by this video, the guys and gals over at minecraftmiddleearth.com are now the Weta of Minecraft.  (except they didn't leave Tom Bombadil out of their world and I imagine if you could bump into Faramir he wouldn't be such a sniveling prat...)  The massive scope of their book-faithful recreation of Middle Earth is the reason the word "nerdgasm" was created.  And when I say massive scope...I mean they hit the end of the Minecraft world.

To the best of their knowledge, they are the first group of users to accomplish this feat making them the collective Christopher Columbus of Minecraft.  But alas, their world is indeed flat.  They are currently in contact with members of Mojang to acquire more room as there is still much work to be done.  All is explained by the incredibly dorky commentary provided during this video tour.  And before you start mocking said commentary - it is a 45 minute virtual tour of Middle Earth created on Minecraft.  Did you expect Barry White to narrate?  Did you think this video would get you laid?  It is simply nerd bliss, so I encourage you to revel in the geek-speak as much as I did.

Visit their site by clicking <a title="Minecraft Middle Earth" href="http://www.minecraftmiddleearth.com" target="_blank">here</a> and take the opportunity to join the White List and explore their world for yourself!  And when you do, please come back to Nightmare Mode and leave tales of your journey in the comments below.  If exploring for yourself is too daunting a task, view the video and let us know your impressions of what they have accomplished!  I'm sorry what you built in Minecraft no longer looks as impressive as it once did.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/catherine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8558" title="catherine" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/catherine.jpg" alt="" width="545" height="250" /></a>

Vincent Brooks, you poor, poor sod. I really don't like you. Your highest aspiration is that things stay exactly where they are; you've lived life completely on cruise control. Honestly, I'm surprised you've gotten this far--that you have a job, friends or a girlfriend at all.

Catherine is full of, well, unlikeable characters. Not in the sense that they're bad characters or anything, they're good characters. They are not there to be liked, they are there to press buttons more than anything else. Each of Vincent's friends is the embodiment of an ideology or approach when it comes to love. You've got the wide-eyed sap, the stoic mystery man and the jaded cynic...and then there's you, the wildcard.

This is a huge departure from the common picture-perfect depiction of love found in most games (at least, that I've played). These people are older and flawed, permanently flawed. They've already done their growing up, this is who they are. I don't get the sense you will influence them or see them grow, and that will throw a lot of people off. You do uncover their story, but it doesn't seem like you are there to fix them or put them back together. They're there to make you think about how you will approach love when the time comes, and to give you a sense that you're not in this mess alone. They are the other stray sheep, after all.

There are big issues at the heart of Catherine, the likes of which--to my knowledge--have yet to be properly addressed in games. Marriage. Love. Cheating. These issues are turned into somewhat of a spectacle. The game starts off by introducing itself as a part of the 'Golden Playhouse' programming--as in, a show, a play, something that an audience watches. This didn't hit me until sometime on the second day, when I noticed that there was an audience that was cheering Vincent on as he climbed the blocks. It was then that I noticed that the upper left corner of the screen had the Golden Playhouse logo on it.

This got my gears turning. What does that contextualization signify, exactly? Are we the audience, voyeurs of some sort? I think so. I'm reminded of reality TV a bit, actually. We like to watch train wrecks and their day-to-day drama. This drama usually sparks the audience to judge and gossip with one another regarding what they've seen. In some senses I think of Catherine as a social experiment of a sort. The questions at the confessional reinforce this feeling, we think of the issues presented in Catherine in a larger sociological context. I can't help but be fascinated at what people answer in these questions, what it says about them. Speaking to friends, it seems that the 360 audience and the PS3 audience think quite differently from one another when it comes to love and life!

I could keep going on and on about the ideas in the game, but let's touch upon the gameplay a bit. I'm pleasantly surprised, actually. I abhor puzzle games for the most part. I'm terrible at puzzles and often consider them to be a chore. I braved Catherine because it looked good, and, well, it's Atlus. The Persona team, even. So far I've found the puzzles to be addicting, and, even in situations where I'm replaying a level over and over again because it's so damn difficult...I'm having fun. Right now, I'll chalk it up to how fast paced it is, it's a rush to the head. Boss battles in particular, even though they're hard as fuck, I adore. Maybe I'm a masochist.

One last note that I just edited in right now. This game. This game. It's so damn addicting. The puzzles, yeah, as I just mentioned but the plot, too. I want to know what happens. It's the first game in a very, very long time that I'm playing for the plot. It's not just that it's so saucy--though it is--but the mystery surrounding everything is intriguing, too. I've got some serious Catherine on the brain.

Well, I'd best be going now, I have a date. With Catherine!]]></content:encoded>

Promptly passed the pillow case off to a friend, donned the boxers and shorts at my girlfriend's request, and played. I'm liking it so far. The creators must have been aware of the expectations serious critics of the video games industry had for it. I don't really get the impression that the game is supposed to be "deep." In fact the narrator makes a crack about that fact when you play the Rapunzel arcade game in the Stray Sheep.

I just think the game wants to tell an unorthadox (for video games) story about a guy who is struggling with his relationship. I don't think it's going to meet anyone's expectations as an exploration into the complex web of wackiness that is human sexuality, but it's so far interesting enough that I can't wait to get home from work and play it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<ul>In the purest sense of the word, to be weak is to lack control - over others, oneself, or one's surroundings. In regard to gaming, much has been written on the use of player character weaknesses toward other game characters and of players' own weaknesses for certain actions (grinding, collecting, etc) to drive game experiences. Developers of a horror game may refuse the player's avatar a direct way of defending himself against his nightmarish antagonists to foster anxiety and dread. Developers of social networking games often exploit the human tendency to obsess to encourage impulse micro-transactions. In both cases, game designers use weakness to promote a certain experience. What has received less attention - and has the potential to fabricate greater complexity and depth in open-world role playing games - is design around player character weakness in the game world at large. Not physical or compulsive weakness, but insignificance. Artificial intelligence designers have long known that simply making enemy characters more difficult to defeat increases their perceived intelligence. Likewise, making player character influence in-game as difficult to achieve as would be realistic according to the density of an intricate society is a technically feasible manner of contributing to the player's sense that he is immersed in a fully-realized world.</ul>
<ul>It is common for marketers of open-world role playing games to brag about the player's power to influence their title's world. Often, the player's arrival in the game world leads to drastic changes. The player's avatar may quickly rise to social prominence - he alone has the power to initiate significant events, and soon becomes a favorite topic of conversation among non-playable characters. In Bethesda Softworks' <em>Fallout 3</em> (2008), for example, the player has the power to orchestrate the nuclear destruction of major population centers, and the in-game radio frequently broadcasts his movements. Player characters in Bethesda's <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> (2006) may become the leader of all three in-game trade guilds, the champion of the arena, a venerated crusader, and the god of an entire alternate dimension. In short, these game worlds revolve around the player's character.</ul>
<ul>Investing such power in the hands of the player could be a vestige from more linear games. In any case, while the short-term emotional payoff of dramatic influence is appreciable ("Whoa! I'm the leader of the Mages Guild, the Fighters Guild, and the Thieves Guild!"), it ultimately undermines open-world games' depth and therefore their lasting appeal. Realistically, a world in which the player character can achieve inordinate significance cannot have been particularly complex. When players realize this, consciously or subconsciously, their immersion is compromised. Working backwards, then, players who find themselves relatively insignificant in an in-game society perceive the game world to be more intricate - perhaps more complex than it literally is, or than technology allows.</ul>
<ul>A powerful example of the use of player insignificance to promote immersion in spite of technical restraints is Bethesda's <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em> (1996). Discussions of <em>Daggerfall</em> frequently target the game's technical instability, and indeed the game (which is powered by Bethesda's vintage XnGine) is plagued by crash and save corruption glitches. Why, then, is the second entry in the now blockbuster Elder Scrolls franchise appreciated as one of the most immersive computer role-playing games? Competing with <em>Daggerfall</em>'s bugs as a common thread of conversation is its epic size: 487,000 square kilometers (according to Bethesda) - about twice the area of Great Britain. Modern open-world RPGs tend to be about .01 percent of that size (taking the areas of <em>Fallout 3</em>, <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>Morrowind</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>, and <em>Far Cry 2</em> into account). For example, <em>Oblivion, Daggerfall</em>'s modern sequel, is host to a world forty one square kilometers large. It is difficult to grasp how large <em>Daggerfall </em>is. And indeed, the game's physical scale would mean little in terms of immersion if it did not also apply a deviously complex web of character and institutional relationships.</ul>
<ul>The XnGine may not be able to convincingly simulate the daily lives of the millions of characters who live in <em>Daggerfall's </em>15,000 cities, towns, and dungeons.  It certainly is unable to realistically render environments as varied and complex as the game's lore describes. In terms of player immersion, however, thoughtfully designed mechanics of socio-political interaction more than make up for the game's technical shortcomings. Each of <em>Daggerfall's</em> forty three provinces has its own unique government, its own knightly orders, and its own hierarchy of nobles and social elites. Each of those social or political circles values a different way of life. Each finds common ground with or vilifies a diversity of other factions. Into this convoluted society steps the player character, an agent of the imperial government. I like to think of him as a naive city boy. Tasked with unraveling the mysterious circumstances of a king's death and ghostly reincarnation, he must come to understand and exploit the area's intricate social interactions.</ul>
<ul>Working for the supporters of a consequential faction's allies to indirectly raise his reputation with those who may have a key to the mystery, the player feels small and insignificant. His relative social weakness leaves him unable to directly command access to important clues regarding <em>Daggerfall's</em> mystery; instead, he must sidle toward his goal. <em>Daggerfall's </em>other mechanics of social influence also reinforce the player's insignificance. For example, players are evaluated for promotion in trade guilds (the game provides institutions for mages, fighters, thieves, and assassins) only on certain dates. Their advancement is based upon skill in guild-promoted activities, reputation with the guild and its favored factions, and volume of quests completed on guild orders. Should the player become lax in these duties after promotion, they are liable to be demoted, losing reputation and access to services. If they should ignore their duties for too long, players are likely to be expelled from their guild. Guilds do not exist to cater to the player, but provide essential services that the player's character must work to earn if he hopes to survive.</ul>
<ul>By limiting the player's power in a massive world, <em>Daggerfall's</em> social system actually expands upon his immersion. The difficulty of influencing the game's society by developing complex relationships or performing dutiful guild work reinforces the illusion that the player is insignificant to the functioning of the game world - the game world was not created for the player character to romp in, it seems, but is a living society that exists independently of the player. Consequently, the player experiences immersion in a fully-realized world.</ul>
<ul>It would be technically infeasible to literally simulate a game world as complex as players perceive <em>Daggerfall's</em> to be. Artificial intelligence representing socio-political factions with the capacity to communicate information about the player (and all other relevant game characters) in real (game) time to other factions, and to disseminate that information among its associated factions would, bluntly, require programming resources that could be better spent perfecting more conspicuous aspects of the game. However, such tedium isn't necessary to achieve the desired effect. Making player influence difficult to achieve through relatively simple design tasks fabricates heightened complexity; it is the equivelent of redistributing player and enemy hit points to make enemies seem smarter. There, the player becomes "physically" weaker, and the enemies stronger; consequently, the enemies are better "able" to survive player attacks and appear smarter to the player. Likewise, weakening the player's role in a game society increases their perception of that society's complexity and contributes to their immersion.</ul>
<ul>Games that offer significance at the expense of immersion tempt players with intoxicating power, but quickly make their lack of depth plain. "Granting" players weakness seems counter-intuitive; we've all read about the gamer power fantasy. Supposedly, video games are "fun" because they allow players to control their world. They offer a sense of significance and security that gamers miss in real-world society. However, especially in terms of open-world roleplaying, over-influence is hollow. What fun is power in a shallow world created as if a playpen for the player's character? Much more fulfilling is insignificance, requiring the player to be immersed in a game's unique society and lore to achieve influence. If the objective of open-world RPGs is to absorb the player in a fully-realized world, then designers of such games must be careful to enforce the illusion that the world does not exist solely for the player's amusement. Weakness is a powerful tool in achieving this effect.</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<ul>How many times have you applied to participate in the beta testing for a game you were excited about? How many times have you actually been chosen? If you have my luck, the answer is zero. What if all you needed was a credit card to get into the beta testing for Blizzard's next MMORPG? It sounds crazy, but I'm noticing a new form of funding being used by independent developers that could very well be the future of beta testing and preorder bonuses for AAA and indie devs alike. Several independent developers have taken a new approach to getting the funding they need by allowing players to pay to play early builds of the game before it's released. It's basically alpha/beta testing that requires a credit card instead of an application with your computer specs attached.</ul>
<ul>I bring this up because it turns out if it's fun and playable, players are absolutely willing to pay to play a game that isn't finished. Think about all the beta testing opportunities you've submitted an application for. Chances are they were for a game you just couldn't wait to play. Would you have paid ten bucks to guarantee your spot? I know I would have, especially if that was ten bucks off the final price when the game was released. That's certainly a better preorder bonus than a piece of in-game content you're probably going to forget to download. I still haven't downloaded the armor that came with my Halo Reach preorder.</ul>
<ul>Then there's kung-fu bunny brawler Overgrowth from Wolfire Games. Anyone who preorders it (for the full game price of $30) is given a code to download and play the game in its current alpha state throughout the development process. Every week preorderers can download the latest build of the game and fool around with what is basically a set of placeholder environments with some characters to run around and fight with freely complete with a set of basic mod tools. Why would anyone pay for that? Well, Overgrowth has some very impressive mechanics in place. Having preordered myself, the hand-to-hand (with some weapons thrown in) combat system is very fast and fluid and unlike any other game I've played. It's surprisingly fun to just drop into my favorite level and spawn some enemies to cripple with my mad martial arts skills.</ul>
[caption id="attachment_8601" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="Amazing artwork by Aubrey Serr."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pfdpog.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8601 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pfdpog.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="250" /></a>[/caption]

My point is that Wolfire Games has given its customers a mighty delicious taste of what they're working on in exchange for their support in funding the game's development. Over 7,000 preorders have been sold and it's popular enough that the weekly development diaries end up on Gametrailers. Over $200,000 is a damn good budget for an indie game.

Developing an independent game is tough. Your average indie dev probably has a day job and spends his evenings chanting "Minecraft" over and over again while he cracks away at his unique game about a sentient, self-propelled flyswatter on a morally ambiguous quest of fly genocide. When done right, player-funded development can be exponentially helpful. You get constant player feedback, you're basically getting free testing, and with the right management development costs can be covered. This kind of transparency is exactly what modern-day gamers want. We live in a world where the relationship between player and developer is becoming progressively more personal. With message boards, Facebook pages, and Twitter feeds players can communicate directly with the magicians that craft the magical experiences they spend their hard-earned money on. For the most part, this is a good thing.

Of course, this method won't work for everyone. If this gets big we're most certainly going to see projects with paid beta options that don't really have much direction, but if you pay just $1.99 you can move the placeholder gradient sphere around the placeholder gradient environment before anyone else! Or worse yet, a promising concept that has had enjoyable alpha builds for several months could lose momentum and end up in vaporware hell. There's also the debatable issue of whether this will put test teams out of work once more people discover that people are willing to pay to perform duties they used to pay other people to do. The danger is there, and until there's a more structured and streamlined way to develop in this manner there will always be people attempting to take advantage of this rising phenomenon.

Oh hello <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2F" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>! Didn't see you there. This wonderful website is actually one of the best outlets for developers that need funding from interested players. It's also a much more organized way to gain funding for a game or any other creative project. Kickstarter has all the bells and whistles set up for budding creative minds to set a funding goal, create incremental rewards based on the amount of money pledged, and post updates on the project's progress. All obligations are called upon only if the goal is met, so it helps weed out any dubious attempts to scam people out of their money. I wouldn't be surprised to see future game projects on this site offering early builds or beta keys to their more dedicated supporters.

As a quick aside, here's a few games that have become a reality thanks to Kickstarter:

<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2F27467991%2Fdashkin-a-game-of-high-speed-challenges-through-br" target="_blank">Dashkin</a>
If you've ever been on Newgrounds, you know who Bitey of Brackenwood is. Did you know the little satyr is getting his own game? This project is actually still looking for extra funding in spite of meeting its quota way ahead of schedule for the sake of rebuilding it from a free Flash game to a console release.

<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2Fmusegames%2Fcreavures%3Fref%3Dlive" target="_blank">CreaVures</a>
This little gem is a gorgeous platformer about little creatures that must venture deep into the forest to rescue their friends and save their home.

<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2F590373879%2Forion-prelude" target="_blank">Orion: Prelude</a>
Dinosaurs. Jetpacks. Mechs. I haven't played this one myself, but it looks awesome.

And what about the AAA developers that are going to take notice of this practice eventually? This is where things get negative. I love me a good high-budget game like Halo Reach and Mass Effect, but these developers don't need support from their customers. They have good relationships with their publishers. So unfortunately the idea of charging for the priviledge to play an incomplete game is going to be seen as, well, wrong by the gaming community and industry both. I think positive execution is possible here, but it will have to be handled in a completely different way. How? I'm still working on that. How about we talk about it in the comments?

Okay, now that you know where I'm coming from, Jordan, here's the question:  if AAA developers want to involve players in the development process, what do you think is the best way for them to go about it?  Also, how could they learn from the whole Mega Man Legends 3 fiasco and the mistakes Capcom made in handling the situation?";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:4:"8591";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:1:"0";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"60cc200338";s:14:"POST_subscribe";s:9:"subscribe";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:8:"Apache/2";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:11:"SCRIPT_NAME";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:14:"REQUEST_METHOD";s:4:"POST";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:15:"SCRIPT_FILENAME";s:59:"/home/users/web/b36/moo.thekruecom/nmm/wp-comments-post.php";s:11:"REMOTE_PORT";s:5:"53570";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:70:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:17:"GATEWAY_INTERFACE";s:7:"CGI/1.1";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:13:"DOCUMENT_ROOT";s:38:"/home/users/web/b36/moo.thekruecom/nmm";s:11:"REMOTE_HOST";s:28:"174-17-156-38.phnx.qwest.net";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"TjbgeAoBDJkAAEgGe1YAAAAr";s:11:"SERVER_NAME";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:76:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/the-player-funded-development-process-8591/";s:12:"SERVER_ADMIN";s:31:"cgiadmin@yourhostingaccount.com";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:13:"gzip, deflate";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:5:"close";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1046";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:11:"SERVER_PORT";s:2:"80";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:11:"REMOTE_ADDR";s:13:"174.17.156.38";s:15:"SERVER_PROTOCOL";s:8:"HTTP/1.0";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:2:"TZ";s:7:"EST5EDT";s:8:"PHP_SELF";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:12:"REQUEST_TIME";s:10:"1312219257";s:4:"argv";s:0:"";s:4:"argc";s:1:"0";}]]></wp:meta_value>

To truly involve players in AAA development, there needs to be complete transparency. I'm not saying the average gamer should know every little detail about an upcoming game, but communication needs to be clear and as often as possible.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah, I don't really buy the whole "lack of fan support" thing either.  If you scope out the internet, it's pretty obvious that there was QUITE A BIT of fan support.

Thanks to my country's archaic media classification system, Xbox Live Indie Games aren't available in Australia, but that hasn't stopped me from observing one important thing: it's host to a <em>fuckload</em> of games. It's bad enough that the industry is getting saturated with AAA titles, particularly shooters - then we've got top notch indies available on the PSN, Steam and XBLA, and now this? Talk about cultural over-bombing. Microsoft's marketplace currently lists <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/XboxIndieGames" target="_blank">1,941</a> titles on the service, meaning unless you're picked up for one of the winter/summer promotions, or reviewed favorably by <a href="http://writingsofmassdeduction.com/" target="_blank">this brave man</a>, it's hard to stand out.

XBLIG dictates games be available 80, 240 or 400 Microsoft Points - approximately $1, $3 and $5 respectively. Indie developer Zeboyd Games released two titles on the service - <em>Breath of Death VII</em>, which managed to moved around 50,000 for $1, and <em>Cthulu Saves the World</em>, which sold approximately 16,000 at $3 a piece. While those earnings of $49,000 far exceed the XBLIG average of $3,800, Zeboyd were unsatisfied, and raised $7,000 to port the game to PC. Two weeks ago, <em>Cthulu </em>and <em>Breath </em>were released as a $3 bundle on Steam.

Speaking to Ars Technica, Robert Boyd, one half of Zeboyd Games, expressed his surprise with how well the game has done on PC.

"In less than a week, our Steam revenue has actually exceeded over a year and a half of XBLIG revenue for us. We're still a little stunned at how well it's been selling. I can't say how it's doing on GamersGate yet, but I imagine it's selling well there also."

Basic math will tell you that by bundling the games and charging 25% less than they did on XBLIG, they sold over 33,000 copies within the first week. Now, a fortnight after a release, that could well be a few thousand more - not to mention the boost they'll receive from the inevitable Steam sales over the next few years.

Boyd praised the personnel at Steam he dealt with, and the "gazillion" codes they granted him to offer to the press, versus the 50 he received from Microsoft. Moreover, the way XBLIG allows developers to price its games means that $3 is erring on the side of expensive for some consumers, whereas on Steam, $3 for two indie games is a godsend.

While <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/ea-warn-indie-devs-against-self-publishing-8333/" target="_blank">some</a> think self-publishing is no longer a feasible option for tiny devs, XBLIG can be a good starting point if you promote yourself properly - as long as you try take it to Steam and  beyond.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Cat_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Cat_1.jpg" alt="" title="Cat_1" width="450" height="260" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8685" /></a>

The history of education in games is conflicted.  It's hard enough to convince gamers intent on murder or tending farms that an educational game isn't woefully beneath them.  Even if you're convinced to play them, the games are rarely good at what they do.  Being compelling undermines education, and being educational damns you to the bargain rack.

With <em>The Cat and the Coup</em>, Peter Brinson (<a href="http://peterbrinson.com/work.html">of Meanwhile and Waco Resurrection fame</a>) and Kurosh ValaNejad bridge the gap between information and meaty gameplay.  <em>The Cat </em>hooks you by offering you the chance to play as, well, a cat, and then makes you the very specific cat of former Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.

<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/95700/">Go give it a play yourself on Steam</a>.  For free, too!  They're friendly folk.

<em>The Cat </em>is a clever bird, not to mix my animals.  Its politics are not front and center despite its subject matter, and it's perilously easy to just talk about how luscious the Persian styled artwork is, how much atmosphere the soundtrack creates, and how you play as a cat.  It's charming.

To dwell on its charm would miss the prime achievement, though.  Unlike other <a href="http://playspent.org/">docugames like SPENT</a>, which makes its message painfully clear, <em>The Cat </em>trusts its audience to have the brains to figure out what it means and to make their own connections.  The game doesn't want to teach you about a time period, Iran in the early 1950's, that has been swept under the rug but would prefer to pique your interest, to make you inform yourself.  Mossadegh was a villain to us and on-again, off-again hero to his people: a big bad who nationalized oil at the height of the Cold War, a democratically elected man overthrown by the United States' CIA.

By planting the viewpoint in the hands of his uninvolved cat and by beginning at the end of Mossadegh's life, <em>The Cat </em>casts him as a misunderstood hero.  You are the trickster spirit that compels a doddering old man to revisit his past when he was a larger than life political icon.

You're kind of an asshole, too.  You encourage rioters outside of his house.  You spill oil on him.  You jump at him from chandeliers, causing him to hit the ground hard enough to break through a stone floor.  So there's that, too.

That's what <em>The Cat </em>is.  It's putting the player into a role where they can do what they want (who doesn't want to wake up and then torment an old man?) and then gives them a historical context for their dickery.  It's teaching through osmosis.  It builds you up by dropping you through a complex, colorful world and right when you've had enough of terrorizing this old man you learn what your terrorism was proxy for: a coup d'etat orchestrated by outside parties.

The Cat illustrates a path for future docugames: clarity and depth of conscience without sacrificing playability and player interest.  It won some notoriety as an IGF nominee for its nebulous Nuovo award, and it should provide a blueprint for future titles in the genre to follow.]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft's Xbox Live Indie Games service has been much maligned since its inception, with good reason.  It's the equivalent of a dingy, shoddy restaurant with mediocre food and a waiter that seems like he'll try to stab you and take your money the first chance he gets, and <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/steam-power-cthulu-saves-the-world-thrives-on-pc-8628/">games from that service have made more money in one week on PC than they made during their entire lifespan on Microsoft's fun toy.</a>

Back in the winter, a group of enterprising developers decided to try to change this.  Thus the <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2010/11/xbox-live-indie-getting-all-the-games-in-one-week-3088/">Indie Games Winter Uprising</a> was born.  Okay, most of those games were mediocre, but there were some gems in the bunch (Epic Dungeon and Cthulhu Saves the World chief among them), and it obviously worked out well enough that said developers would try to do it again.

The <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/">imaginatively named Indie Games Summer Uprising</a> launches on August 22nd, and will feature ten games, eight of whose identities are known and two of whose identities you can vote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/XBLIG.IGSU?sk=app_190322544333196">on their facebook page</a>.  Watch the video below, then come on back for my thoughts.

Pretty decent collection of quality looking games here.  We have a swell looking fighter in <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=20&FinalistView=true">Battle High: San Bruno</a> that seems reminiscent of Capcom fighters of yore, <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=64&FinalistView=true">satirical RPG Doom and Destiny</a>, a 3-D canabalt alike that looks awful pretty in <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=35&FinalistView=true">T.E.C. 3001</a>, and a neat looking little side scroller in <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=32&FinalistView=true">Raventhorne</a>.  Plus some platforming goodness in <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=37&FinalistView=true">Speedrunner</a> (to be confused with the flash game of the same name) and <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=7&FinalistView=true">Cute Things Dying Violently</a>.  Plus two other, weirder titles: class based 2-D shooter <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=40&FinalistView=true">Take Arms</a> and <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=92&FinalistView=true">Train Frontier Express</a>, because we always need games about trains.

What am I voting for for the last two games, you ask?  Well hilariously premised <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=91">Author Adventure</a> gets my vote for having Mark Twain, William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austen as protagonists.  After that, I'm torn between inventive looking <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=31">City Tuesday</a>, zelda-alike <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=1">Blossom Tales</a>, and novel <a href="http://indiegames-uprising.com/Games2.aspx?gameID=86">Be Stiff</a>, which adds fog of war to an infiltration platformer.  There's others, though.  So many others.  And markedly few of them suck, which is a welcome change from the usual line up of terrors on Xbox Live Indie Games.

So go check it out!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Call of Duty Elite</em> pissed off a lot of people - why should players have to pay for a social and statistical integration that we get for free in every other game? Capitalizing on that disillusionment, <em>Battlefield 3</em> developers DICE responded with the <a href="http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2011/06/03/bf3-goes-to-e3.aspx##">Battlelog</a>, which offers "powerful social tools, feeds and detailed player stats." Cool. Kind of a given, and a smart business move, but for something like that to be considered an add-on shows how much we've lowered our expectations over the last few years.

Nonetheless, EA scored one against Activision - but now the goliath publisher have shot themselves in the foot, revealing what's essentially a continuation of the publisher's anti-used-game <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/eas-project-ten-dollar-explained">Project Ten Dollar</a> initiative introduced last year. Speaking to <a href="http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/news/battlefield-3-online-pass.html">GamerZines</a>, DICE's executive producer Patrick Bach said the game would "probably" need a register code for players to access online content, meaning if you're buying the game used, prepare to add an extra $10 to that purchase. Bach tried to distinguish the code from an 'online pass,' justifying it as a means for DICE to pay for the game's backend.

"The whole idea is that we're paying for servers," said Bach, "and if you create a new account there is a big process on how that is being handled in the backend. We would rather have you buy a new game than a used game because buying a used game is only a cost to us; we don't get a single dime from a used game, but we still need to create server space and everything for you. We want people to at least pay us something to create this because we're paying for it. It was actually a loss for us to have new players," he continued. "Hopefully people understand why. It's not to punish people. To us it's compensation."

Call me cynical, but this is a used game we're talking about - the original purchaser will not need that server space again unless they buy another copy. Is Bach trying to suggest it costs $10 for every single account used to play<em> Battlefield 3</em>? Gee - I really hope they don't sell 10 million copies, or they might be <em>100 million dollars</em> up shit creek.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that you're not looking at this from all possible angles, the method you are describing makes sense but is not very practical.
Example: Person A buys BF3 new, Person B steals/borrows Person A's copy of BF3, Person B pays $10 to play on-line, by your method Person A loses his "space" on the server to Person B, is that fair to Person A? I don't think so.
I really don't think that anyone has the right to remove a user from a server without a justified reason.

EA's reason for the doing this makes sense, they have servers they have to maintain. If don't we support them, then they won't support us and at least they are being somewhat truthful to us unlike some other companies.

Plus this online pass thing has been going on for over a year now, so saying that EA "have shot themselves in the foot" is really a fair statement, they had it last years Need for Speed game and various games, for them to "shoot themselves in the foot" would have been them NOT implementing this type of fee.

Anyway that's just my thoughts on this, I'll be buying the new so none of this really affects me]]></wp:comment_content>

The reality is they want to make money of 2nd hand purchasers, don't try and paint it as something else.  I can understand that, but EA's online pass system is shite.  BF3 is off my Christmas list now (well...probably) so it looks like it's going to be Gears 3 and COD 3.  I'd rather encourage online usage to be free, especially since I already pay for an XBox Live gold membership, which is suppose to cover any Xbox online compatible game :/]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pigs_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pigs_1.jpg" alt="" title="pigs_1" width="460" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8702" /></a>

Where did July go?  Oh July, you siren of months.  You harlot of twelfths of a year.  Where have you gone?

Yes, July is over and gone, and with it we must mourn the passing of another omnitopic.  This one, our third, was Weakness.  But you knew that, gentle reader!  You've kept up with us, and you've already read all these articles!

Wait, you haven't?  Hold on, let me check...no, this is a bad thing.  A very bad thing.  Here's a list of what we wrote on the topic of weakness this month.  Check them out!

-<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/weakness-the-catalyst-of-survival-7880/">Geno wrote our first piece on the topic,</a> giving us a general overview of the ways games make us weak or not weak.  How removing power from the player's hands creates a good kind of tension.  You know, things like that!

-Next came <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/the-lion-the-lamb-and-the-fear-of-weakness-8245/">Olivia with an article on horror games</a>, treading the fertile ground unearthed by <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>.  Fun, frightening times.

-Finally, <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/immersive-insignificance-8569/">Sam wrote an article not about <em>Amnesia</em>, but about <em>Daggerfall</em>.</a>  That's a much different game.  Didn't you get the <em>Amnesia</em> memo?  What?  You forgot it?  Tarnation.  Anyway, yes.  Daggerfall and your insignificance in its world.

That was it.  Was that it?  Yep.  It was it because the rest of us wrote other, equally fine articles on equally fine topics.  Check those out, too!

And stay tuned next month for another Omnitopic.  Or whatever you do on the internet.  I guess you don't tune the internet.  That would be weird.  Watch this space!]]></content:encoded>

Yes, you read that right. The leading man himself, the actor who plays Cole Phelps in the critically acclaimed <em>LA Noire, </em>revealed that he's not very good at interrogating people in his own game. <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/features/aaron-staton-my-favourite-game" target="_blank">Speaking in an interview with Edge</a>, Staton admitted that part of the only reason why he is able to move forward smoothly is because of his wife--and this is that Staton is actually a gamer. <em>And </em>he's read the script! "I made it to the first two cases on the homicide desk. If I play with my  wife then the interrogations go much smoother than if I play on my own;  I am officially the <em>worst</em> interrogator [laughs]."

Of course, that may not be surprising to anyone: interrogations in the game are sometimes frustrating, due to the simplistic truth, doubt and lie system.

Staton goes on to muse over women's intuition, noting that this phenomenon is something that he's seen within his friend's circle. "But I'd heard that from a couple of other friends: they found their  partners, girlfriends and wives were better at picking up the clues. I  don't know if it's women's intuition or something else, but I think it  definitely has something to do with it!"<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/aaronstaton.jpg">

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Warning:</strong> This preview includes detailed mechanical spoilers but minimal narrative spoilers.</p>


<hr />

[caption id="attachment_8710" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Oniken : NES :: La Mulana : MSX"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_MainMenu.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8710" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_MainMenu.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.oniken.net/p/download.html"><em>Oniken</em></a>, like <em>La Mulana</em> before it, is a love letter to gaming days of yore. An era where limited color palettes, memory and chiptunes more or less forced developers to focus on aesthetic design and gameplay rather than on intricate narratives or showcasing high-fidelity graphics. An era where protagonists like <em>Oniken</em>'s Zaku, a superhuman hero fighting against totalitarian militants in the apocalyptic world of the year 20XX, could thrive and be the norm rather than some tongue-in-cheek throwback. Yes, <em>Oniken</em>, rather than just referencing old games or featuring pixel art due to budget constraints like many other indie platformers, is full retro (or retreaux, if you prefer). The art, music, story and four-button + D-pad controls all work to emulate the look and feel of an 8-bit game, and the disciplined design makes the overall experience very charming.</p>


[caption id="attachment_8711" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="8-bit can still be beautiful."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_JetskiTransfer.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8711" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_JetskiTransfer.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately, the 8-bit era also spawned the term Nintendo Hard, which was basically shorthand for "Expect to fail. A lot. And maybe break a controller or two." In a way that I can only describe as the inverse of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, the "full retro" part rears its ugly head by glorifying uncompromising level design. The developers pride themselves on <a href="http://www.oniken.net/p/about.html" target="_blank">declaring that the game is hard</a>, but I think that's a little inaccurate since, with the exception of boss battles, the only challenge in the game comes from avoiding instant death traps and annoying enemies. If it weren't for enemy placement that's strategically calculated to screw you over, most enemies would be utter pushovers. And if it weren't for water and pits signifying instant death, platforming would be a breeze. Even then, the threat of instant death only becomes troubling when combined with enemies that knock you around. As you might have guessed, aggravating enemies that do just that show up for such occasions like clockwork.</p>


[caption id="attachment_8712" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Fortunately, the quality of the art for the game over screen takes the edge off of losing."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_GameOver.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8712" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_GameOver.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Surprisingly, since it's contrary to the typical desire of making nostalgic games as difficult as possible, the game does offer you a few concessions. Most notably, Zaku can use his katana to destroy many enemy projectiles. Since many games of the era focused on dodging projectiles instead of defending against them, mastering this skill can greatly alleviate the challenge that enemies and environmental dangers pose. However, the ability to crouch is also included, and it serves as a more traditional technique that permits defense via evasion. If that wasn't enough, Zaku, rather than dying in a single hit, has a sizable health bar that can be refilled with pick-ups and that is only truly in danger of emptying when facing particularly stubborn enemies, full-fledged bosses or the aforementioned instant death traps.</p>


[caption id="attachment_8713" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Pictured: Many instant death traps."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_Exploding.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8713" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_Exploding.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Beyond that, two power-ups exist to make your life a lot easier and (like the health pick-ups) can be collected from gray supply boxes that show up from time to time. The better of the two power-ups are grenades that are thrown in an arc and explode upon impact. The other power-up passively extends the range of Zaku's katana attacks and allows him to temporarily enter a "berserk mode" that enhances his damage output and makes him invulnerable. "Hold on!" I hear you exclaim. "The second one sounds awesome and makes the first one sounds mediocre by comparison!" The second one is indeed better, but stored charges are progressively lost when damage is taken, so this handy ability can only be used by people who are playing perfectly instead of by people who could actually use some help. By contrast, the grenades are plentiful and don't disappear upon injury or even death, so you'll probably be using them a lot more often.</p>


[caption id="attachment_8714" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Note that I've lost one life but that I still have a large grenade supply."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_MechaBeast.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8714" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Oniken_MechaBeast.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The current version of the <em>Oniken</em> beta only sports three levels and lacks some interconnecting cutscenes, but is otherwise pretty polished and seems indicative of the final product. If you like the old school masochistic style of difficulty (or can at least tolerate it in exchange for great music and pixel art), then check out <em>Oniken</em> and <a href="http://www.oniken.net/" target="_blank">keep an eye out</a> for a full release sometime in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You have journalism to thank for <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/borderlands-2-confirmed-8741/" target="_blank">knowing about <em>Borderlands 2'</em>s existence</a>. Well, unless you ask Randy Pitchford, that is. Earlier today, when news broke out about <em>Borderlands 2</em>, Pitchford decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DuvalMagic/status/98529291117133824">tweet the following</a>:

"I have long maintained that we will do more with Borderlands. Shoddy journalism is not an announcement."

How ridiculous is that? Reporting something is shoddy journalism? Pitchford, don't you mean shoddy <em>marketing? </em>Ultimately, that's what happened here. Websites who found out about this information before they 'should' have, before your marketing plan was supposed to take effect, websites who reported on this completely factual data, are the undesirables.

Game Informer was supposed to have the scoop, not the gaming blog vultures. And, really, Game Informer still does have the actual scoop: nobody knows much beyond the fact that this is a game, and it exists. Officially. That doesn't matter, though, because by reporting the truth, websites have messed with the marketing campaign and that's not acceptable.

The issue is that game journalists and media outlets are sometimes (not very often, I might add) seen as simply an extension of a studio's marketing department, of their PR department. What, don't believe me? <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/search/view.do?id=a0z50000000tP2JAAU">Take a look at this job opening at EA.</a> It refers to big-name sites, respected sites, as "PR sites."

Right.

Gearbox and marketing scandals are no strangers, we simply have to look back a couple of months and <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/therednergroup-speaks-to-the-dnf-tweet-fiasco-6204/">recall the Redner tweets. </a>Both this <em>Borderlands 2</em> incident and the DNF fiasco are a testament to how problematic the relationship between developers/publishers and journalists is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>Just as every action has a reaction, every choice has a consequence. No matter the magnitude of the choice, from whether or not to cross the street on a red light or joining the army. Unifying for these examples is that you cannot predict exactly what the consequence of your choice will be. The crossing of the street might be the deadlier one if you are unlucky. In the world of gaming today, it seems all the rage to include a morality or a choice &amp; consequence system in video games (they can be said to merge at times). The players must make choices on practically every issue regarding the world they find themselves in as well as making romantic choices. However, these important decisions are too often boiled down into simple Do good or do evil choices, in which any rational being quickly can deduce which choice leads to which consequence. Choices need not be predictable and shallow experiences if the developers are conscient about how they construct their choices. Allow me to illustrate with a personal experience. Here's a recount of one of the stupidest decisions I've ever made in a game, one that I continue to berate myself for even a year after having experienced it.&nbsp;

Being Commander Shepard, fated to be the savior of all in the galaxy and the leader of small group of elite troops hailing from several species in the galaxy, I must make a crucial decision. After we've entered a Collector base and encounter resistance, it is determined that we should split up, but who shall lead the other team? In a show of extraordinary ineptitude, I choose Thane Krios, an assassin whom I had recently reunited with his long lost son. Moments later, I'm sitting next to him, listening to his last words. Had I instead chosen someone more competent to lead the team he would have lived, and we could all have celebrated after the victory. Despite this not being a moral choice, the impact of it is in no way diminished. The focus on choices in games is often centered around those of a moral or ethical character, even though the majority of the essential and life-changing choices we make in life are not moral nor ethical in nature, such as choice of studies and career which affect the course of your life dramatically.</ul>
<ul>

[caption id="attachment_8772" align="aligncenter" width="309" caption="He seems entirely trustworthy"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Creepy_Shepard.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8772" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Creepy_Shepard.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="305" /></a>[/caption]</ul>
<ul>Mass Effect 2 by no means perfects the issue of choices and consequences, although it certainly embraced it by having over <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.g4tv.com%2Fthefeed%2Fblog%2Fpost%2F703209%2F700-player-choices-were-brought-from-mass-effect-to-mass-effect-2%2F" target="_blank">700</a> choices made in the first game carry over into the second. The way that choice is made, its importance emphasized by my crew members and chosen through a menu in which I can only choose each character once during the mission (there are several such choices to make), all make it clear that this is a major decision, and that will have extreme impact on the near future. And considering that the game up to this point has constantly teased you with the fact that this is a suicide mission, it is easy to come to the conclusion that a simple click could result in the death of one of your crew members. Most importantly though, it would still be possible to reload an earlier save and know exactly what to do in order to get all your crew members to survive. This however, goes directly against one of the few principles I have, taken from the unlikeliest of places: Roger Ebert's prattle against the artistic value of video games. In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.suntimes.com%2Febert%2F2010%2F04%2Fvideo_games_can_never_be_art.html" target="_blank">it</a> he mentions in regards to Braid, that You can go back in time and correct your mistakes. In Chess, this is known as taking back a move, and negates the whole discipline of the game. I would gladly rage for hours over Ebert's unwillingness at attempting to understand video games, but in this particular instance I must concede that he's actually right. For choices to have lasting and true impact, they must be irrevocable. As in reality, we never get a second chance.&nbsp;

Despite my criticism of Mass Effect 2, it still does remarkably better at creating effective choices and consequences than, say, Fallout 3. And why? Because Fallout 3's morality choices come with instant consequences that are easy to predict. For instance, if you were to blow up some innocent wastelanders, there would instantly appear a little You've lost karma in the upper left corner of the screen, instantly letting the player know that what they did was bad. Of course, you could claim that ultimately the players' actions in the Wasteland has an impact on the ending, which is true, but instantly manifesting the players' actions with an arbitrary numerical score only allows the players to essentially choose which ending they desire. The players can then calculate how many bad and good deeds they need to make to get the desired ending, especially when the game has been marketed as having multiple endings! I'm not advocating that future projects necessarily should scrap the numerical system for creating consequences, but at the very least hide it.</ul>
<ul><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/You_Lost_Karma.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8773" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/You_Lost_Karma.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="343" /></a>&nbsp;

Although a favored target for scorn, the Call of Duty series has actually used invisible choices effectively, though it appears that it was only for a single installment. The installment subtitled World At War", where the player at several instances unwittingly makes choices. For example, in the Pacific campaign in the final battle, the player must choose between either his mentor Sgt. Roebuck or his squad mate Polonsky who are both being assailed by Japanese soldiers. The emotional weight of the choice comes in as the player can never, no matter how many times he tries to reload the last save, save both of them. If this had been presented clearly as a choice, it would have fallen depressingly close to the "choose between two radically different options", and appeared as a quite tacky addition to the game. In the Eastern Front campaign, the use of invisible choices is even more evident and widely used, as the player on several occasions witnesses executions of German soldiers, and for instance must choose between shooting some unarmed prisoners and granting them a swift death, or allowing the other soldiers to shower them with molotov cocktails prolonging their suffering. The player's actions in these sections define which depiction your squad mate <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fcallofduty.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FChernov" target="_blank">Chernov's diary</a> (the quotes can be find at the bottom of the page) gives of you depending on your actions, falling into the predictable good, evil, but also neutral or "ambiguous" terms.

A similar approach to choices and consequences can be observed in the flawed gem from 2010, Metro 2033, which managed to craft such invisible choices with excellence. To truly show this, let's once again fast-forward to the ending. In the very last chapter, the player encounters a Dark One, the peripheral antagonists of the game, and is faced with a choice, though it is not as evident as in the other mentioned games. Artyom, the character the player controls, stands at the top of a tower amidst of the nuked ruins of Moscow, holding a pistol in his hands. He recalls the words uttered by one of his companions: If its hostile you kill it, spurring the player to do so, despite several instances have hinted that the Dark Ones may not be as hostile as they initially appear. Following the encounter with the Dark One, the player is once again confronted with a choice. Does the player guide the missiles that have been fired onto the area that the Dark Ones inhabit or not? If the player has chosen not to fire at the Dark One he will know their intents are not hostile. At no point does the game give you a clear good or evil decision to make. Those deliberations are made solely in the minds of the players.</ul>

<ul>Also, Metro 2033 circumvents the danger of the player reloading earlier saves by only making the alternate ending available if the player has acquired enough moral points, which are evidently very similar to karma points seen in Fallout 3. However, in Metro 2033 the player only needs to acquire a very small amount of these to make the alternate ending possible, but the key to it all is not telling the player about it. As I was playing the game, I had no knowledge that such a system existed, and thus it was only after I had finished it that I actually learned about the alternate good ending, even though I had actually encountered some of these instances which grant you one of these points. For instance, somewhere in one of the scattered, ragtag settlements in the metro of Moscow a beggar sat, begging for some cartridges, the currency in this destroyed world. I gave him one, not because I desired some arbitrary score to increase, but because I felt genuine pity for the man. The game may have awarded me a point, but it was not the motivation for my choice. This is the closest to the idealized state of choices &amp; consequences in games I have witnessed to date, as the choice is not dependent on wishes for an arbitrary reward, but rather makes it dependent on the morality of the player.&nbsp;

Although no game really has fully captured the concept of invisible choices and consequences into them, it still makes me hopeful for a future where choices are no longer solely quantitative deliberations in the mind of the player, and serve only to create "replay value". Making choices are essential to this medium, and is the key difference that separates it from film. Why should I bother sitting with a controller in my hands or a keyboard &amp; mouse if I have no impact on the happenings in the game? Interactivity is central, and all interactivity really is, is choices, but as long as all their consequences are immediately predictable to the player they will not leave the same lasting impact, as predictability leads to foresight.</ul>

		<title>August Omnitopic: Simplicity</title>

August is the most venerable month, the wisest of months.  The wisest among us are often the simplest, so simplicity will be our omnitopic for the coming twenty odd days.

Okay, that was bullshit.  We picked it because it's important.

The Nintendo Wii first launched in 2006 (five years ago!), and simplicity became a running theme in gaming discussions.  The Wii was the "simple" console, the "casual" console, because it didn't have a lot of buttons and you could play a lot of its games by waving your arms around like a chicken.  The Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, by comparison, were "gamer's" consoles, with loads of buttons, complicated controls, and a higher barrier for entry.  The Wii sold like sliced bread in sandwich season, and the other console companies tried to jump on the bandwagon.

And now we have Nintendo releasing a console that's so complicated I still don't rightly know what the crap it is.  I don't think Nintendo knows, either.

Gaming in general has been in a drive away from simplicity since its inception.  The first mainstream game had two commands: left and right.  Now we have controllers with a dozen buttons, each of which does something different, often in conjunction with others.  Games tell more complicated stories.  They make you do more things for the sake of variety.

We expect complexity, simply put, and when we receive simplicity it feels like a rip off.  Or do we truly want simplicity, but don't know how to ask for it?  These, and other interpretations, are the sorts of things you'll be reading here this month.  Along with our many other works.  

For now, a question to you, faithful reader: what's your favorite simple game?  Would you like it more if it were more complicated?]]></content:encoded>

Between <em>Left 4 Dead</em>, <em>Dead Rising, Dead Horde</em>, <em>Dead Nation</em> and the upcoming <em>Dead Island</em>, the bastards simply <em>won't</em> <em>go away</em>. That's not likely to change anytime soon, as Suda51 throws his hat in to the undead pool with<a href="http://www.lollipopchainsaw.com/" target="_blank"> <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em></a>.

Billed as a third person action game bursting (at the oh-so-tiny seams) with "sex, blood and rock'n'roll," <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> introduces cheerleader-cum-scantily-clad-decapitation-extraordinaire Juliet Starling. Apparently things didn't go so well for her boyfriend, so she carries his head at the end of her mighty rotating blade, as she shreds her way through "zombie rock lords," which could be hinting at some interesting special guests.

Suda51 is teaming up with Dawn of the Dead writer <a href="http://www.jamesgunn.com/2011/08/01/my-new-video-game-with-suda15-grasshopper-lollipop-chainsaw/" target="_blank">James Gunn</a> for the <a href="http://www.andriasang.com/e/galleries/2011/08/01/lollipop_chainsaw_screens/2132456831/" target="_blank">potentially cel-shaded</a> affair, which is set to be published by Warner Bros. on 360 and PS3 next year.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you don't know what the Humble Indie Bundle(from hereon out "HIB"), first shame on you, second, it's a bundle of five indie titles sold for whatever the hell you want to pay. The games work natively on Windows, Mac, and Linux, can be redeemed on Steam, comes with no DRM, and lets you choose where your money goes. You can choose to put it towards the developers, or charity.

Basically, it's an amazing deal and everyone should jump on it while they can.

In order to get the second HIB with the third, you have to pay at minimum the average price others have payed for the bundle, about(as of this writing, at least) $5.31 USD. So on top of <i>Crayon Physics Deluxe, Cogs, VVVVVV, Hammerfight, And Yet It Moves,</i> and free Minecraft access until August 14th, you get <i>Braid, Cortex Command, Machinarium, Osmose,</i> and <i>Revenge of the Titans</i>. Also there's another bonus game, <i>Steel Storm</i>, that was added.

So if you haven't bought it yet, now's the best time to do so. And you should, even if you already own some of the games.

<div>It is with great pleasure and a heavy heart that I present the completed Minecraft Mandala. Over 70 hours of construction have finally come to fruition. Not including the untold hours spent collecting and harvesting resources. I can't help but look at the completed piece and smile. All my work has finally paid off. But it is an empty smile. I know there is only one thing left to do.</div>

[caption id="attachment_8897" align="aligncenter" width="621" caption="Click for full resolution"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Equestria-With-Mandala_normal_north.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-8897" title="Cart with completed Mandala" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Equestria-With-Mandala_normal_north.png" alt="" width="621" height="641" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div>First, though, I feel I need to explain a few things. I have to confess that due to in game limitations, I did have to cheat and use an inventory editor for some of the dyes. Survival single player simply does not produce enough Red Flowers, Ink Sacs, Cocoa Beans and Lapis Lazuli without me having to extend my map for many, many hours in every direction and hollow out the earth in the process since these are rare and nonrenewable. Nonetheless, all 96200 blocks of wool were collected by hand, as were all of the other dyes needed.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>I spent more hours than I cared to record running around the outside of my frame shearing sheep (since I no longer needed to punch them), killing squids, harvesting cacti, cutting down/planting trees, killing spiders and skeletons, and generally gathering anything I would need. This project also required me to complete 2 other projects. One to collect all the bone meal I would need and the other to store the massive amount of blocks I was harvesting.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>For the bone meal I made a fully automated monster trap. 100 by 30 by 7 in size featuring water flows to push the mobs to a lava blade and more currents to push the dropped items to a drop off point. My favorite part of the trap though was that I could take a mine cart from my base, swing close enough by the drop off point to pick up all the items, then end the ride right where I started. This was my first ever successful monster trap. The output was very nice, providing me with plenty of bone meal and lots of string which I used to make more wool blocks.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>The Vault as I called it was a room filled to the brim with chests. A total of 245. I did manage to go a little overboard on it though. I didn't really need that many chests but if I ever do a mega project like this again I will be glad I have the space. And a neat bonus was that it intersected a cave which led me to a vein of diamonds and a heap of coal. Huzzah!</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/javaw-2011-08-05-12-22-05-50.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8896" title="The Vault" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/javaw-2011-08-05-12-22-05-50.jpg" alt="" width="621" height="325" /></a></p>
I do have to admit that I was apprehensive about placing my first block. I knew that everything I was about to do wouldn't last. That I would work so very hard on this and then it would all be gone. Why start? There really wouldn't be any point to it. Doing my best to squelch the seeds of doubt, I pressed on reminding myself that I had done so much already. If I didn't continue everything I had already done would be for naught. What would be the point in that? Not being a fan of starting a project and then quitting half way through I kept my head down and placed my blocks. My doomed, short lived, impermanent blocks

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't think that I would be breaking any new ground by saying that there are a lot of video games with antagonists. After all, conflict is the foundation of narrative, regardless of medium. Without antagonists, the Harry Potter books would have gone, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. And they were. Eventually they died. The end. Of course, antagonist has a rather broad definition- both the Dark Lord Sauron and the titular spaceship from <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em> can technically count as antagonists. All that matters is that the antagonist is a force that prevents the protagonists from immediately achieving their goal, and I defer any further inquiry on the matter to a literature class.

Most video games include antagonists, outside of purely abstract affairs like Breakout, and even in that case one could call the bricks the antagonist, if a rather unambitious one. Of course, like most stories, video games will sometimes try to make the conflict a bit more focused by attaching a face and a name to whatever malevolent antagonistic force is at work. The original Star Wars did this with Darth Vader, and Super Mario Bros. did this with Bowser (incidentally, I think that I've just laid the groundwork for the most bizarre fanfic crossover in history). However, problems frequently arise when we try to treat the face and name as an actual character instead of a this is what you're supposed to dislike signpost. Bowser, despite being large and all, wasn't a terribly interesting character in his earlier incarnations- he was just the last thing you killed before seeing the ending and deciding to play through the game again. Mehrunes Dagon from The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is another, more recent instance of this sort of character: his only real role in the story is to A) set the events of the game in motion offscreen, and B) be defeated in order to signify that the game is indeed over. He has no dialogue, no character interaction beyond having his hindquarters presented to him in a most spectacular fashion, and, by extension, no personality.

The main reason for these sorts of characters lacking personality is that they don't receive much screen time. While Star Wars can cut away at any time to show Vader plotting, giving orders, going through underlings like a hyperactive schoolchild goes through Skittles, etc., most video games are restricted to following around the player character. If the antagonist doesn't show up around these characters, then he isn't seen, at least for extended periods of time. This can be a problem when the main antagonist has something like Devourer of souls in his job description- it can be difficult to justify why this individual that you're trying to give screen time is hanging around the player character without devouring their soul and prematurely ending the game. This can be justified once or twice, and a few antagonists can be fully and interestingly fleshed out in just that- see Sovereign from Mass Effect 1- but if you want to give them more exposure, it's best to resort to alternative means.

One way to do this is to characterize the antagonist indirectly, using things like conveniently placed audio logs or written accounts. This allows the player to see more of the antagonist as a character, while also explaining why his soul is not presently being devoured. A suitably complex instance of this can be found in Oblivion's precursor Morrowind, where it is through the virtue of in-game lore alone that the antagonist, Dagoth Ur, was made into an actually interesting character: all of the lore dealing with Ur is written from different, conflicting perspectives, each of which presents their own view of his motivations and personality. It is never made clear which, if any, of the perspectives is objectively correct, thus handing the player the information necessary to form an opinion about the character without handing a prepackaged opinion to them on a silver platter with a light garnish.

A more common approach is for the antagonist to address the player character through some sort of one-way means from a distant location, which allows them to react to the player character's actions directly without being on-hand to end the game much more quickly. In Half-Life 2, one of the first things you see after getting off the train is Dr. Breen's smiling face explaining why the human race being sterilized is so wonderful, and it doesn't really get better from there. He pops up infrequently during the game, each time showing the player how he interacts with citizens, soldiers, and finally the player character himself. In Mass Effect 2, virtually every plot-important battle is punctuated by Harbinger periodically taking control (I refuse to say the meme) of one of his soldiers and shouting a few insults before being pulverized by a hail of gunfire. The fact that he not only keeps coming back, but never even loses confidence in his superiority, eventually gives the impression that this is somebody who A) is very powerful, and B) really has it in for you. In Fallout 3, the very first radio station you get a chance to listen to upon exiting the vault you lived in all your live is that of John Henry Eden, president of a group called the Enclave whose goal, as pontificated in length by Eden, is to rebuild America. Gradually, this stranger's voice begins to seem like one of those overly friendly old men who sit next to you on the bus and tell you about the time they were served steak instead of fish at a restaurant. In the wake of the player actually seeing the somewhat morally ambiguous actions taken by Eden's Enclave, the sunny tone of Eden's speeches instead comes across as downright sociopathic.

Antagonists are often the most remembered part of a story. After all, while Luke Skywalker is nice and heroic, Darth Vader has become iconic to the genre of science fiction. It's for this reason that, if you want to give an antagonist a personality, it's imperative to do it well. A well-characterized antagonist can be the deciding factor in whether a game is merely good, or actually great.

Or much of anything else."]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8965" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/team-bondi-celebrates-l-a-noire-success-by-declaring-bankruptcy-8950/la-noire-screens_03-01-2/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8965" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LA-Noire-Screens_03-011.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="229" /></a>[/caption]

In what has become a sad turn of events, the Team Bondi debacle may end soon with the studio filing for bankruptcy and closing their doors for good.  The release of L.A. Noire was followed by cries of "foul" not heard since psycho detective Cole Phelps last badgered the hell out of an innocent, defenseless widow during a simple interview.  Complaints of 100-hour work weeks without overtime pay and current and former Team Bondi employees being left off the game credits have left studio head Brendan McNamara circled by flames of controversy.

The smoke from said fire is beginning to thin and it appears to have left Bondi as nothing but a smoldering pile of rubble.  Recent online sources headed by postings at the Neogaf discussion boards have all pointed toward an unfortunate conclusion to this unfortunate story.  Rumor has it that bankruptcy will be filed and  remaining Team Bondi members will be swallowed up by KMM, a Sydney-based media outlet that includes games under their large umbrella.  Beleagured Bondi founder and studio head Brendan McNamara is also said to be joining KMM.

Those fearful of what will become of the L.A. Noire IP, fret not.  The IP is owned by Rockstar and will likely be safe.  Rockstar notably "influenced" production of L.A. Noire quite heavily when they were less than satisfied with Team Bondi's results at the time.  This is most likely why the game received the full open world treatment we all experienced months ago.  With the amount of involvement Rockstar had during development, it is unlikely that any plans for a sequel or the inherent gameplay would be impacted by the bankruptcy of Team Bondi.

If this rumor proves to be true, what are your thoughts?  Did Team Bondi get what it deserves for the treatment of their employees?  Do salary employees deserve overtime?  Is "crunch time" too prevalent in the development of video games?  Would you be against "crunch time" if it meant less quality in your favorite video game?  Post below!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It never ends, does it? The runaway freight train of an indie game <em>Minecraft</em> recently reached three million sales, one sixth of which happened in the last three months. Not bad for a game that's still in beta.

Sales aren't likely to slow down any time soon either - according to an <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/features/1386/QA-The-men-behind-Minecraft" target="_blank">interview with Develop</a>, Scotland-based developers 4J are working on a Kinect-enabled Xbox 360 version due later this year, while Mojang themselves are working on an Android port.

<em>Minecraft </em>will be officially released at MinecraftCon in Las Vegas on November 11.

<em>Angry Birds </em>is a game about insane birds that I have never played.  Why are the birds angry?  I don't know.  Maybe they've had a bit too much to drink.  Maybe they've been sexually deprived for a few weeks, leading to a lot of pent up tension.  Maybe their wives (do angry birds have wives?  Do they have angry chicks, or is a chick's mood to be determined by its zodiac sign?) have decided, en masse, to deprive them of sex.  Maybe they have a lot of yard work to do.

Maybe enough people haven't played their game.  That's why they're angry.  They're angry because not everyone in the world has played their video game adaption.  Maybe if more people played their game they'd stop being angry.

<em>Angry Birds </em>is a money making scheme disguised as a game.  People play it, but in its ubiquity it has become a phenomenon beyond games.  It's become a game about advertising and branding instead of a game to be enjoyed.  Someone will make a movie of <em>Angry Birds </em>and Roger Ebert, that great film critic, will give it a review of one star, saying it's less worth your time than the game.  Video game aficionados will take this as an affront to their gamerly instincts, but Ebert will be right.  Why should we be up in arms about the game, anyway?  After all, gamers don't play <em>Angry Birds</em>.  People play <em>Angry Birds</em>.  Some of those people might play video games, while others' awareness of pixels and polygons might stop at <em>Bejeweled </em>and, maybe, <em>Tetris</em>.

<em>Angry Birds </em>is <em>Tetris </em>for the modern generation.  Instead of manipulating falling blocks to a Russian score of beeps, you're angry, and you throw things.  At least, I think you throw things.  My life is a blissful cocoon of unawareness, like an ostrich with its head in the sand.  <em>Tetris</em>, though, I know, and this is <em>Tetris</em>: it is a game prized for its addictiveness, a game noteworthy for its out of nowhere success.  It was a true victory for the little guy.  That the two are comparable in terms of their appeal and their addictiveness speaks volumes for <em>Angry Birds</em>, despite its marketing department.

<em>Angry Birds </em>is a game disguised as a money making device.  Whenever someone's made a game for the iPhone or a flash game over the past two years they've wished it was <em>Angry Birds</em>, a game so elegant in its simplicity.  It is a game that someone like my father, a man who has been unable to play many games in the past ten years, can play and enjoy as much as anyone else.  When Nintendo talks about accessibility and appealing to the casual gamer, a euphemism in their minds to the female gamer, they're talking about <em>Wii Fit </em>and the Vitality Sensor and other ways to completely ignore video games.  When Rovio talks accessibility, they mean literally a game anyone can play, a game anyone can enjoy.  They are the true face of accessibility: simple and enjoyable, like a bucket full of popcorn.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/angrybirds2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/angrybirds2.jpg" alt="" title="angrybirds2" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9004" /></a>

<em>Angry Birds </em>is evil hidden behind a happy face.  What can Rovio want except to make every game like theirs?  The success of <em>Angry Birds </em>reveals to us a hidden future, where one day we will all be chained to our iDevices, playing games simpler than <em>Super Mario Brothers</em>.  What path besides this can be imagined?  <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/epic-cheap-app-games-are-killing-us--199223.phtml">Cheap, portable apps are killing the games business</a>, and Rovio and <em>Angry Birds </em>are heading the charge.  They want a world where games are cheap and brainless, and where they are everywhere with us, taking up our precious spare moments.

<em>Angry Birds </em>is a game so insidious, so pervasive, that in the space between these two paragraphs, I was able to download and install it on my computer.  I was able to play the first level.  Apparently the birds are angry because some pigs stole their eggs.  I wouldn't think of this because whenever I eat an egg I immediately start craving bacon, and I imagine that would be awkward for the pigs.  The titular birds found a slingshot and threw themselves at the pig's castles.  On the side of my browser, there is an advertisement telling me to Enjoy the heat with <em>Angry Birds </em>flip flops!  I don't know what kind of person needs <em>Angry Birds</em>' flip flops.  I guess someone must buy them, but I'm pretty sure they aren't anyone I want to know.

That's the kind of thing <em>Angry Birds </em>has become, but consider it at its purest expression: a game for everyone.  Accessibility is bandied about a lot like a magic fountain that will suddenly make video games hugely profitable, but at its core is a simpler idea: that everyone deserves the opportunity to play video games.  They might not be playing your games, but they deserve to have something made for them.  Just like Justin Bieber must exist to tittilate tweenage girls, so must <em>Angry Birds</em>, to show mothers and parents that video games aren't terrible.  That they will not rot their children's minds, even if they secretly do.

<em>Angry Birds </em>is a piece of garbage.  It's not even entertaining.  If this were a review, I'd derisively label it <strong>schlock </strong>and laugh all the while.  It's about as much fun as throwing a little foam stress ball at a wall and trying to catch it.  It's about as difficult, too.  The game is completely mindless to the point where it is brainless, a true zombie game.  It wanders around the pathtubes of the internet, calling out, Brains! and we stop and feel sorry for it.

The only way to lose in <em>Angry Birds </em>is to make it impossible for you to win.  You do this by causing a pig to be surrounded on all sides by fallen planks without somehow killing him.  I imagine the pig probably feels something like a survivor of a building collapse, his oxygen slowly fading away.  He's bacon, but you can't kill him.  So you fling furtive birds at his hidey-hole, hoping to cause enough force to knock him out for good.  With one bird out of four you can create a no-win situation in <em>Angry Birds</em>, forcing you to restart.  How is this good game design?  How is this popular?  Are people that stupid?

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/angrybirds3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/angrybirds3.jpg" alt="" title="angrybirds3" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9005" /></a>

<em>Angry Birds </em>is a pointless exercise, a show of how shallow and brain dead casual games can be.  There's no thought involved with each throw, just a relaxing tug left of the mouse, tug right of the mouse.  There's no mechanics, no challenge, no adversity, no narrative, no anything that makes a game worthwhile.  It is meaningless, repetitive drivel designed to make the player feel better about how frustrating life is.  

Sorry your life sucks, <em>Angry Birds </em>says, at least it doesn't suck as much as I do.  The game pauses and adds, now buy my flip flops.  This is what games are to Rovio: something that sucks less than awful jobs.  I hope the bar for real games never falls that far.  I hope I never reach a point in my life where I'm playing a FPS, get shot by a griefer, and say, Man, at least this sucks less than cleaning out people's toenails for less than peanuts.  That's the rock bottom of the video game industry, and <em>Angry Birds </em>shows us how quick and brainless a ride to the bottom it can be.

Now excuse me while I go back to playing <em>Angry Birds</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mode 7 (Frozen Synapse) Interview</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mode 7 recently came to fame with their turn-based strategy game <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.frozensynapse.com%2F" target="_blank">Frozen Synapse</a>, which was well-received by critics and gamers alike. I had the pleasure of interviewing Paul Taylor, who, amongst other things, wrote the story for the single-player part and composed the soundtrack for Frozen Synapse. Paul told us a multitude of things about the company and Frozen Synapse, from the early days to what lies ahead. Read on!

<strong>Firstly, could you tell us something about who you are, your background in making games, and how Mode 7 began? </strong>

We're a team of three based in Oxford, UK. Our Lead Designer and Lead Programmer is Ian Hardingham. He started Mode 7 after he left university because he wanted to try making his own games.  Having worked in the mainstream game industry a bit to get some experience, he really wanted to explore his own ideas outside the confines of someone else's company.

I joined Mode 7 with him while I was still at university, doing sound and music.  My role in the company is basically to take care of anything creative that isn't within Ian's sphere, so things like art direction, writing, audio and some single player things.  I also do all of the marketing and business development for Mode 7.

Robin Cox is our Level Designer and Tester - he joined us a few years back and is a vital member of the team, helping us shape some aspects of our games.

<strong>Growing up, what spurred you to make a career out of creating games?</strong>

<strong> </strong>My Dad was an IT teacher around the time I was born, so I was always surrounded by computers and cool things with flashing lights on them!  Throughout my life, I've always loved creating imaginary worlds and writing electronic music, so games are a great context for me to do that. I think essentially though, one thing that really took me into the games industry was Ian's drive to make original interesting games.  I don't think I'd necessarily be in this industry without him doing the kind of thing he does.

<strong>Could you tell us something about the inception of Frozen Synapse? What inspirations have you drawn upon for the game? Did the final version of the game differ much from your original idea? </strong>

Laser Squad Nemesis was the big inspiration - Ian played a lot of that with one of our friends in around 2004, and that set him on the path of thinking about ways he could design a game that captured some of that sensation. The big issue with those kind of games is waiting around to get into an interesting situation - there's just so much build-up and setting up of your units.  Obviously, that suits certain kinds of games, but Ian was mostly interested in the tactical side of things so Frozen Synapse was about emphasising that.

I think FS differs in some respects from its origins - we did go for a fairly straight rendering of an X-Com style game initially - but things like having no health bars and basing combat around when units spot each other really changed the gameplay.  After that, it was really about working around those things. Of course, we have random level generation and that's something which really changes the nature of a game as well.

<strong>Frozen Synapse is very different from your first title, Determinance. What did you learn from developing Determinance that carried over into Frozen Synapse? Did you have any experience with the tactical strategy genre before starting on Frozen Synapse? </strong>

Nope, no experience!

We really learned that the aesthetic and the gameplay have to go hand-in-hand, and that you should really finalise your gameplay before you start piling in assets.  With Determinance, a lot of things were constantly in flux, like the control system, whereas with Synapse we were very careful to make sure that certain things got locked down early and weren't changed. I think Determinance really taught us a great deal of things NOT to do - that was really about trying loads and loads of stuff and finding our feet in terms of making games.

[caption id="attachment_9046" align="aligncenter" width="478" caption="Determinance, a multiplayer sword-fighting game, was Mode 7's first venture into the world of games."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/determinance.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9046" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/determinance.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="270" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>As an independent developer you don't have as many funds as the big guys to spread word of your game. How did you specifically go about telling people about your game? And was this something you'd considered from the start of development?</strong>

Yes, absolutely.

Well, from doing Determinance we did manage to get some press contacts, so the first thing we did was to make those people aware that we were working on something - we announced the game with just a logo and concept image, like a big publisher would!  Even though that didn't exactly make a massive splash, it did start to build up interest.  Journalists who we'd known for a while like Brandon Boyer, who was writing for BoingBoing at the time, posted about us and we started getting interest from there.

During development, I tried as much as I could to build up a bit of a following on ModDB and on our blog - we even did a podcast for a while - we were just trying to get people interested.  This was really challenging because it's not a very asset-heavy game, so we didn't have a lot to put out there. Things became a lot easier once we released our beta - we got some amazing support from big, influential UK sites like RockPaperShotgun and Eurogamer - that was really the turning point.

I've focussed a lot on PR because I think FS is a game that spreads best through word-of-mouth, rather than advertising.  That's one of the reason we do our free-key-for-a-friend offer.

<strong>During the development of Frozen Synapse, you i<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.mode7games.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ff%3D26%26t%3D2456" target="_blank">nvolved</a><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.mode7games.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ff%3D26%26t%3D2456" target="_blank"> the community in the crafting of the storyline</a>, but how much of an influence did they have on it, and how much do you ultimately think it benefitted from going through this process? And how much has the community meant in general for you during development?</strong>

I had never written a game narrative before, so I wanted to get the community on it early and point out the big obvious flaws.  I had some pretty amusing feedback (as you might imagine - story is such a subjective thing) but also some really key points in terms of how I was communicating certain things.

I had deliberately wanted to really alienate and confuse the player from the outset - I hate overly didactic, plodding, expository writing more than anything else in the world.  However, I'd just really succeeded in pissing people off, which wasn't exactly what I was going for, so I had to reign that in a bit, while still sticking to my original ideas.  That feedback was vital for that and I'm really grateful to have had it.

In general, there is no way we could have developed this game without our community.  Certain people were vital in helping us test certain things towards the end and we're eternally grateful to them.

In terms of feedback, as a developer you get a LOT of feedback and one of the biggest skills you need to have is a filtering system.  You have to listen extremely closely when people are telling you that something feels wrong, but most of the time the solutions they put forward, or even specifically what they're identifying, are not actually relevant.  It's something you have to do some detective work with.

<strong>The music in Frozen Synapse has also been praised (by TotalBiscuit for instance). Going into development, how much did you consider the use of music to generate the desired atmosphere?</strong>

<strong> </strong>As I mentioned, music is always vital to me.  Music in games is something that I find incredibly powerful from an atmospheric standpoint - if you look at something like Streets of Rage, which is, at it's heart, a very simplistic game...that's entirely driven by the combination of amazing art and music.  I mean, there are a million side-scrolling beat 'em ups but nothing has that atmosphere, and much of that was down to Yuzo Koshiro's soundtrack.

For Mode 7, we have a slightly weird situation where one of the co-founders is a musician.  So, for my part, I always want to deliver music that is just more ambitious and more interesting than you'll find in *any* other game, be it triple-A or indie!  I set myself high standards!  I don't know whether I've quite achieved that here, but the reaction has been quite astonishing - just people posting the tracks up on YouTube and then getting hundreds of comments about how the music is "the best score I've ever heard" and so on - that means a lot to me.

TotalBiscuit's reaction to the music on his video was probably one of the highlights of the post-launch period for me! Someone like that, who has based his career on being cynical, just raving unreservedly about how awesome it is...that really made all those long nights of endlessly tweaking hi-hat sounds worth it for me!
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FrozenSynapse_Outcome.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9047" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FrozenSynapse_Outcome.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<strong>Frozen Synapse has been a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.mode7games.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ff%3D26%26t%3D2456" target="_blank">financial</a> and critical success, getting great scores and plenty of appraising words. Did you at some point during development think that it could be so successful?</strong>

<strong> </strong>Well, you have these different ranges that go from, "We can definitely do as well as X game" to "I really can't see why we shouldn't be able to do X number of units if the game is a hit", but you never quite know what's going to happen.

I certainly didn't think we'd be pulling in scores like 9 / 10 from Eurogamer and Edge; I definitely didn't think I'd be writing the news post for Penny Arcade - that's kind of surreal and nobody can ever really predict that.

We did have some indications that the game was good though - the two big things for me were seeing members of the public come in off the street and get engrossed in the game at Nottingham's Gamecity festival, and also Kieron Gillen's preview - those two things made me believe that we were working on something that was a bit exceptional.

<strong>Now, over two months after the official release of Frozen Synapse, are you still getting new players to your game, or has the initial wave subsided? What are you doing actively to keep the old players in the game?</strong>

<strong> </strong>Well, sales of any indie game (Minecraft excepted, though I shouldn't really have to say that!) go in waves.  So you have a wave at launch and then another wave when you do a sale or promotion, and so on.

However, with FS, what we're seeing at the moment is that the base rate of sales is very high.  There is a level below which sales really don't want to go, so that's great!

In terms of keeping the older players engaged, we're just about to release a patch which has a lot of fixes in it.  We're really serious about fixing those problems that people have and trying to get everyone the best experience possible.  Centralising the servers again was something we did along those lines.

We're also about to release the first bit of DLC.  It's going to be a collection of small things, just to test the water - if people like what we're doing there, then we'll definitely go ahead and do some more ambitious additions to the game, but for us that's all about proving that people want us to keep working on FS.

<strong>What obstacles have you met as an independent developer? Or has it solely been a positive and liberating experience? How has your relationship with Steam been, and what do you think Steam means for independent game development in general?</strong>

<strong> </strong>Obstacles...obviously, the big one is time.  We had to spend time doing other work to support ourselves during the development of FS, and that meant not having a great amount of time to work on it at certain points.

Things like QA and bug-testing can be a bit brutal in a small team - that's when you really do have to crunch properly and that's fairly unpleasant for everyone.  I certainly find it quite hard to stay healthy during very intense periods of work, but that's just life and you have to find ways of coping with it.

But other than that, even when we didn't have much money, I was still doing precisely what I wanted to be doing with my life and that has almost infinite value.  The conventional thing to do in life is find a job that roughly matches up with your abilities, but if you ever have the opportunity to do *exactly* the thing that you want to do then it's incredibly important to go for it. The value of getting up every day and working towards a goal you've set yourself, rather than some arbitrary thing dictated by someone else's ambitions, is almost impossible to quantify.

Our relationship with Steam has been fantastic - for such a huge and powerful company they really listen to developers and are very flexible based on how you want to do things.  They will take the time to debate issues with you and let you try things.  Steam means that there is a platform out there to bring indie games to a mass market of gamers, and that's something nobody should ignore.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MoreFrozenSynapse.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9048" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MoreFrozenSynapse.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="266" /></a>

<strong>What advice do you have for other independent developers?</strong>

<strong> </strong>Read Derek Yu's piece called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fmakegames.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1136623767%2Ffinishing-a-game" target="_blank">Finishing A Game</a> - that's actually one of the best pieces of creative advice I've ever seen and I agree with all of it.

Once you have some experience, that's the time to be ambitious.  Create some good core gameplay, then go mad on the subsidiary features.  We didn't need to have a giant campaign with a story in Frozen Synapse, but we did because we knew we could accomplish it and because we wanted the total package to be almost overwhelming in its scope - once you have a solid base to work from, go for it!

<strong>As game developers and gamers, what do you think of the state of the industry today? Is there any particular direction you wish it to move?</strong>

<strong> </strong>The industry is so multifaceted - we are always constantly amazed, amused and in awe of something the things we see happening.  New distribution models are really changing the nature of games, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

Certainly, the level of quality in indie games developed by small teams is going through the roof - we're in a much more competitive environment, but I think that's good as we have the tools to compete.

In terms of where I would like the industry to go...I always want to be in situations where the right thing to do is focus on quality, so whatever will facilitate that for us!

<strong>What does the future hold for Mode 7 and Frozen Synapse? You've been releasing plenty of updates and patches for Frozen Synapse, but do you have any plans at the moment of creating other games? If so, can you say anything about it? Will be in the vein of Frozen Synapse, or do you intend to go in entirely different directions?</strong>

<strong> </strong>We have recently had the first production meeting for our next game, but we can't say anything about what direction we're taking yet - we will in due course!  Sorry to be boring!

But, in the near future, expect to see more FS DLC and additional content.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EA2D Becomes Bioware San Francisco</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36408/EA_Confirms_EA2D_Is_Now_BioWare_San_Francisco.php">To Gamasutra</a>, EA confirmed Friday that their 2D studio, EA2D, has been renamed Bioware San Francisco. The studio has developed titles such as <em>Dragon Age Journeys</em> and <em>Dragon Age Legends</em>, flash games that were released in the pre-launch days of <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>and<em> Dragon Age 2 </em>respectively. Despite its fairly humble history in game-making, the studio managed to attract Soren Johnson, formerly with Firaxis, who worked on <em>Legends. </em>

This was confirmed just a day after EA announced major organizational changes at the company, as several high ranking executives received new positions, and Bioware became it's own label, after having been a part of the EA label ever since the company was acquired in 2007. In addition, casual game developer, PopCap (Peggle), will be a part of the EA Interactive business, joining other casual and mobile game developers such as Playfish.

With the announcement of Bioware San Francisco it smells like EA is planning a greater move into the casual, and most importantly, Facebook market, with John Riccitiello stating that "We're focusing on building our intellectual properties/franchises into year-round business". And who can really blame them for doing so? In a gaming world where marketing and branding becomes increasingly important, it is of the essence that you build up some hype around it. Releasing Facebook games and the likes which promise bonuses in the full game is one way of doing so.

		<title>Six Things We&#039;d Love to See in Borderlands 2</title>

I loved <em>Borderlands</em> like the son I've never had.

Well, I tried to love it.  Unfortunately, like my hypothetical son, <em>Borderlands</em> had some major problems: it wet the bed every other week, it couldn't eat cereal without throwing the bowl against the wall yelling, I am a golden god!, and it was so dreadful at its schoolwork that we had to put him in a special class.

Wait, no, that was the son.  <em>Borderlands</em> had its own set of spectacular problems.  Fortunately, unlike my proverbial son, there will be a <em>Borderlands 2</em>, and there will be a chance for Gearbox to fix all the problems that cropped up in the first title!

If only I could reimagine my son, though.  Cletus, get off the bus!


<strong>1. Better Online Capabilities</strong>

I don't know how the online worked for <em>Borderlands</em> on the consoles, but let me give you the PC gamer's view of <em>Borderlands</em> multiplayer.  The first time I booted up <em>Borderlands</em>, I wanted to play four players with two of my college buddies and one of their friends.  It was Diablo with guns!  It was going to be awesome!

Then we realized it went through Gamespy.

The last game I remember that used Gamespy was Command and Conquer: Generals.  That was a BILLION years ago.  A billion.  Dinosaurs were still alive in movies then.  That first day we managed to play exactly zero minutes of <em>Borderlands</em> together, despite spending three hours figuring it out.  And it never got better.  It.  Never.  Got.  Better.  Well, it got a little better.  I could actually play it now, but I'd have to put up with a ridiculously antiquated multiplayer service to do it, and there would still be major problems.

So, Gearbox, please: if you change one thing, don't use Gamespy.  I know you guys have had tussles with Steam in the past, but use Steamworks.  Or use something else.  Something legitimately stable.  If you release <em>Borderlands</em> again using a decent online multiplayer component, I would pay fifty dollars for it.  Well....

<strong>2. More replay value</strong>

I've played Diablo 2, conservatively, twenty times.  I could play it another twenty, too.  I've played Torchlight more than I should have, too.

I've played <em>Borderlands</em> once.  I don't know if I could play it again.

<em>Borderlands</em> has a very simple problem in terms of replayability: all the characters are, basically, the same.  They all have guns, and they use those guns to kill 95% of all enemies.  Sure, they each have one additional move.  The Siren can teleport.  The soldier can build defenses.  Et cetera.  But none of these are game changers.  None of the leveling paths feel any different from the others, and none of the powers feels new enough to really, truly, be different in practice.

So when I say <em>Borderlands</em> 2 needs more replay value, this is what I mean: I mean it needs a leveling system.  It needs more individual moves per character, and it needs more class-restricted weapons, so that it feels like I can replay the game and not have the exact same experience.  I want the novelty I'd get if I started playing Diablo 2 as a Druid and started focusing on elemental, a class I've not played for years.  I want each character to feel like a new way to play the game.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Borderlands_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Borderlands_2.jpg" alt="" title="Borderlands_2" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9070" /></a>

Actually, let's build on that point.  There were four classes in <em>Borderlands</em>, and three of them sucked.  No offense to Brick, Roland, or the ridiculously birded Mordecai, but they all offered the same gaming experience.  They found enemies, circle strafed, and shot them a lot.  Sure, Brick could take more hits, Roland had a turret that let him circle strafe differently, and Mordecai could instantly kill anything, but they fought the same.  Only Lilith, the Siren, had variety, in that she could teleport around the field.  She fought differently from everyone else.

Better replay value would come easiest from giving us better character classes to play, and giving them deeper, more interesting ways to interact with the world.  With guns.

<strong>3. More incidental story</strong>

Something <em>Borderlands</em> doesn't get enough credit for is its story.  Not its big, macguffin filled main plot, but rather its incidental plot.  Patricia Tannis (http://nightmaremode.net/2010/06/character-focus-mays-feature-788/) sums it up perfectly: rather than focus exclusively on narrative, characters like Tannis give the player ways to access the world.  Really, all the secondary characters were good and filled with unexplained personality which served to make us feel like the world of Pandora was alive.

So what I'm asking for is not a change but rather a logical continuation of something that worked in the first game: lots of character in the characters.  Make sure the quest givers have names and faces we remember like Ms. Tannis.  I feel like Gearbox know how to create quality characters who can be humorous without being caricatures, but then I remember Duke Nukem Forever*.

On the plus side, between when this article was written and this article was published, the (http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/06/first-fragments-of-<em>Borderlands</em>-2-revealed/) dreaded Game Informer drip feed of news has revealed that yes, <em>Borderlands</em> will have more dynamic NPCs.  Will they be the Patricia Tannis type or the kooky but ultimately empty type, though?  That's the more meaningful question.

<strong>4. More Guns, Better Guns</strong>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Borderlands_guns.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Borderlands_guns.jpg" alt="" title="Borderlands_guns" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9071" /></a>

<em>Borderlands</em> had a lot of guns.  That was its schtick.  The problem was, most of those guns were useless to the point where they could never be anything but vendor fodder.

What I'm looking for is twofold.  First, I loved the imagined competition between various factions of gun makers, who competed for your hard earned money.  I'd love for each gun maker to be ever more distinct, so that the choices you made in terms of firearms mattered even more than it did.

Second, I want better guns.  <em>Borderlands</em> had a complicated random generation system that served to give us a decent variety of firearms experiences, but the true problem was the variety of base guns.  If there was ever a game that could have taken a page from Ratchet and Clank and made a ton of really weird gun templates that could work in its wacky universe, it was <em>Borderlands</em>.  Instead, we got very basic guns that occasionally shot fire or rockets.  Which was nice, but we could have had so many more ludicrous guns.  We could have had mine shotguns.  We could have fired big horrible tornadoes.  Flamethrowers.  Ice throwers.  Rockets that produced angry, malicious ferrets.  There were so many possibilities, and all we got were the occasional rocket gun.

We need more, in short.  More crazy guns.

<strong>5. Less Busywork</strong>

These last two points compile my major complaint about <em>Borderlands</em>: too much of it felt procedural and not in a good way.   Good procedural generation keeps things fresh by preventing you from memorizing the layouts of places.  Diablo 2 did this.  <em>Borderlands</em> made you feel like you were doing generic quests too often for the money and experience in a stagnant world.  While the gunplay ended up high quality, it felt like most of the quests were pretty mediocre.  Sure, there were stunners in there, but most of the time I felt like I was doing a quest that had been slapped together in a spreadsheet without a lot of thought.

So give us more thoughtful quests.  Make sure we remember the things we do in the game, not just for the quality of the character giving the quest to us but because the quest itself is interesting and fresh.  Keep the plot tight, and keep the sidequests tight.  Make more of them like the Tannis quest line, where we were doing something that contributed to the story of the world as well as providing us with a narrative.  Give us reasons to do things besides money we'd never spend on anything.

Ham-fisted into this point will be bosses, because the bosses in <em>Borderlands</em> often felt like busywork, especially in single player.  Most of them sucked.  Really sucked.  They were enemies with tons of health that you were forced to circle strafe around or, in the case of the obnoxious vehicle boss at the end of act two, they were enemies you had to flail around at and hope you did enough damage before they brutally murdered you.  They sucked, and I'd love to see them improve.

<strong>6. Better navigation</strong>

One thing I completely forgot about about <em>Borderlands</em> before being reminded by my many and valued fellow writers was how absolutely terrible the navigation was in <em>Borderlands</em>.  The lack of minimap was criminal.  The mapping itself, which gave you big blue shapes and said, Do something with this! was about as bad.  Really, for a game where you had to go lots of places, <em>Borderlands</em> managed to make it as hard as possible to travel around.

The inclusion of a mini map would clutter the HUD a little bit, but it would keep us from having to pause every minute to see where we're going, something that completely breaks the flow of the game.  It's a simple solution to a very simple problem, but it's something that would make <em>Borderlands</em> a hell of a lot more fun to play.

I have to admit, as someone pretty staunchly anti-sequel, I'm excited for another <em>Borderlands</em>.  It's the kind of game I want there to be more of: <em>Borderlands</em> is an interesting genre combination, and it was a game where major improvements could be pretty easily made.  So I'm excited to see where they go with it, and what kinds of changes they could offer.  Hopefully the new game fulfills the promise of the old.

*Okay, Gearbox partisans, don't close that browser immediately.  Don't!  Down boy!  Gearbox have made some really good games over the years, and I know they're not 100% responsible for Duke Nukem Forever.  They're, at most, 20% responsible for the first tripe A game this generation not to be able to pay enough money to get reviews above 80.  But they're the ones who put their names on the box.  They said, This is funny, and this is vital, and we will release this!  Okay, maybe they said, This will make us a carton of money! and released it for that.  A good artist realizes that the work he created was utter shit and drowns it in the river, because if he releases it will destroy his reputation.  That's Duke Nukem Forever to Gearbox, but with another degree of separation.  We know they didn't make all the mistakes in the game, but they said those mistakes were worth playing.  And for that we can make fun of them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A man rebels against an evil empire.  He finds love, only to lose it to the cruel twist of fate.  He loses himself, only to find it again in a misty place.  He faces off against a father figure in a foreboding locale.  And, in the end, he is triumphant.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Simple_01.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Simple_01.jpg" alt="" title="Simple_01" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9083" /></a>

Anyone would say I'm describing Star Wars, but only someone particularly bright (or who's read the next paragraph) would say I'm also describing Final Fantasy VII.  The structural pieces of both the crowning achievement of sci-fi film and Japanese video game both feature roughly the same plot.  The fiddly bits are different, but at their cores they tell the same story.

A week or so ago I was talking to a friend of mine about what made Harry Potter great.  We bandied about all sorts of ideas.  We talked about its evocative fantasy before realizing that, yes, all of that had been done before.  We talked about its plot, but then we realized its plot was confusing tripe that doesn't make any sort of sense under thoughtful analysis.  We thought it was the characters, and while they're certainly good characters they are not enough to carry the story by themselves.  No one I know reads Harry Potter because of the titular character, the boy who has no personality.

No, the reason Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Final Fantasy VII all succeeded the way they did is simple: their narrative follows a very simple string the reader can follow by osmosis from having experienced it so many times, while the color around it paints each world as something that spawns pounds of fan fiction on the internet.

Literal pounds.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Simple_02.gif"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Simple_02.gif" alt="" title="Simple_02" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9084" /></a>

The best plots in video games are simple, while their stories are complex.  They create evocative worlds where we can imagine other action occurring off screen, while telling a very simple plot.  We can go play old Super Nintendo RPGs nowadays and enjoy them because, while the plots they tell are simple, they have worlds that our imaginations can fill in.  Their stories spark our imagination.

But let's go back to plot.  The best plots, full stop, are simple, not weighed down by considerations that will overwhelm the viewer, the reader, the player.  Narrative, at its best, is a simple thing.  We crave conflict, and a narrative with a delicious bit of antagonism as its hinge is much more likely to move smoothly than one which buries its hooks deep in a well of distracting details and relationships.  We're much more likely to follow and enjoy a story with a plot hook we can follow (a murder mystery at a high school, a boy's quest into adulthood, saving the world) than we can one that's bloated and absurd (a political war between two factions, trying to save your family from destitution, working at a laundromat).  

And yet many video games go down this road, burying us in unending waves of detail before giving us anything to truly bite on.  You are not given conflicts as motivation, but rather a vague sense of what past video games expected of you to do to advance.  You go to the next town because you did that in Dragon Warrior.  You click on the red dot on the map because that's what heroes do: they click on the red dot.  You're working to make fifty gold because you need it to escape from destitution, even though you seem like one of the richest, most powerful people in town already.

The most recent glaring example of this kind of playing with expectations is Dragon Age 2, which took a bland and unlikeable cast and then put them in no situations which felt even remotely interesting.  They were all too complicated.  Hawke and his family were fleeing from this overwhelming torrent of dangerous, hateful creatures, and rather than focus on the life and death struggle they were going through the emphasis fell on the conflict between Aveline's husband, a templar, and Bethany, Hawke's mage sister.  Yes, their animosity kept the player informed of the larger plot that would, eventually, come to be in hand, but it made one of your sibling's eventual deaths cold and emotionless.  And once you got to the main game it got no better.  Rather than offering the player a hinge of conflict for motivation, it decided to throw a number of unrelated ideas out, preventing the game from ever really finding its narrative traction.  

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/simple_03.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/simple_03.jpg" alt="" title="simple_03" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9085" /></a>

There were a lot of complicated plot elements, but there was relatively little story.  The City of Kirkwall was one of the most interesting in the world of Dragon Age, as someone who has read obsessively on the franchise, but in practice it comes off as cold and unfeeling.  It's a place where encounters are around every turn and there's probably dragons even though dragons are rare and magnificent because dragons are more interesting than conflict.

Contrast this to a game like Bastion.  Bastion has a very simple plot: find a bunch of macguffins, restore the world.  You want these items because your house got destroyed, because your life's been destroyed..  To this very, very simple base is added a heaping helping of stylistic flavor, an eventual question of human nature, and, finally, at the very end, new and interesting twists.

The best narratives, the most memorable of narratives, do this: they hook you with what you know.  As someone who experiences a lot of media, I'm always allured by the idea of plots that tell something completely different, but when I actually get around to them I usually find them flat and difficult.  It's hard, nearly impossible, for someone to get into something that doesn't offer an easy method of access.  A story's got to have a beginning you can latch on to.  It's got to give as much as it takes; while I love new ideas, the foundation of any story needs to be the old, to let the player find their way into the fantasy of the world.  Complexity doesn't ruin stories, but it is important that the simple and the familiar is the base, so we can latch onto the story and the plot.

Let's go back to Final Fantasy VII for a moment.  FFVII succeeded because it took a very natural plot and developed it into different directions.  If I were a literary critic, I would describe the basic story of VII as monomythic.  Campbellian, for Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar who discussed how all stories were essentially the same.  I wouldn't agree with his point on all issues (though I won't fault you for doing so; he has a much more impressive name than I do), but in this case I think it is valid: Final Fantasy VII followed the monomyth.  It was a story we'd heard so many times before, gussied up in a new for 1997 fall sweater, ready to hook with its narrative and impress with its details.  It found emotion in the plot, and it found lasting appeal in things like the city of Midgar, the character of Cloud, and that song that plays in Cosmo Canyon.  People were saddened by Aeris' death, they related to Tifa and Barret*, and they were mystified and enthralled by Vincent the half Dracula.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/simple_04.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/simple_04.jpg" alt="" title="simple_04" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9086" /></a>

Now, how about its sequels?  Anyone who is anyone will admit that Dirge of Cerberus was misguided and pretty uniformly terrible.  Its weakness came from its focus on Vincent, the most confusing and ridiculous character in Final Fantasy VII.  Vincent, red cloak and all, represented the worst things about the game: its excesses, its attempts at being mysterious, its coolness.  Unfortunately, a lot of fans loved Vincent.  They thought he was a great character when he was just an empty personification of the games' style, and they clamored for more of him.  Square Enix, in their wisdom, gave us that: a heaping chunk of style, backed up by no discernible plot.  Vincent's motivations are that he is mysterious, the cop out of young adult literature.  You can make a mysterious character do anything, but you'll never believe it if you look at it objectively.  Dirge of Cerberus gave us a fashionable shell to an awful plot.

Many games have tread down this path, and most of them have died.  Rather than focus on telling a story that will hook the player, they tell stories designed to mystify and, more importantly, to make good trailers.  Everyone gets excited about games about Otaku slackers with lightsabers, being a personification of 1990's war, and being a badass rebel wizard, but the games themselves offer us nothing memorable.  Forgettable complexity, designed to get teenagers excited about the idea of the franchise rather than to craft a quality plot.  The plots we remember are the ones that place us as something simple, in a wonderful, amazing place, doing incredible things to accomplish simple goals.  That, in the end, is what we'll remember.

*Sure.  Why not.  I know a lot of people with gun arms that can also become a chainsaw or a wrecking ball if you equip the right thing.

***It is here, after the dust has settled, that I will tell you that all of this is quite obvious in other fields like film, literature, et cetera.  My mission, since I started blogging here over a year ago, has been to talk about video games like other media are talked about; it's only when that happens that they will be seen as truly legitimate.  One of my fellow writers raised this point, and I felt it salient to point out that yes, I realize all of this is truly obvious to a film critic.  Is it obvious to someone who reads about video games, though?  Don't know.  I hope so, but it's always good to throw things like this out there.  Besides, this month's theme is simplicity, right?  Might as well present a simple concept about simplicity.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm well aware that you shouldn't get all worked up over trailers, especially teasers, but when I saw the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlZqrG1bdGtg" target="_blank">teaser for Dead Island</a> I was instantly enthralled. Could this finally be the zombie game that packs the emotional punch that other zombie games have lacked? Could it capture the desperation, blind fear and feeling of isolation that recent films and series' like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0289043%2F" target="_blank">28 Days Later</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt1520211%2F" target="_blank">The Walking Dead</a> succeed at? After having <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DT2xFFRgl-oM" target="_blank">watched some in-game footage</a> I'm not so sure. The game looks splendidly entertaining, no doubt, but it doesn't seem to emphasize the survival part of survival horror. Sure, you still have to scavenge tools for your weaponry, but having official missions to undertake could take all of the tension out of it. Rather than dropping the player into a hostile environment without any particular set goals, the developers have opted for a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fps3.ign.com%2Farticles%2F118%2F1185181p1.html" target="_blank">Fallout 3-esque open world</a> and even added special zombies such as the Drowner, effectively placing the game in the arcade-style genre. But why haven't there been more survival-style zombie games that try to enter the psyche of the survivors? First, though, what differentiates a "survival" zombie game from an arcade-style zombie game?

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/28-days-later.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9097" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/28-days-later.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="258" /></a>

Firstly, there must be a scarcity in terms of tools, ammunition, food and other apocalypse-essential supplies. This will add to the feeling of isolation that such survival games need to instill in the player, coupled with a lack of information on what's happening on a big scale. Because the zombie apocalypse is bigger than merely a small national or international crisis, it's bigger than a war, maybe even a nuclear one, however devastating such a war may be. The zombie apocalypse is an extended natural disaster that targets only humans and human society, and it doesn't stop until every single one of us has joined the ranks of the walking dead.

Secondly, the zombies must be portrayed accurately to achieve the right dread an apocalyptic survival game needs. To achieve that terror, one must first understand why zombies are frightening. The key to this fear stems from two factors: the zombies likeness to human beings, and their endless, mindless push forward in the hunt for brains, flesh or whatever they crave. The first factor is crucial, as it reminds us that these creatures are only human husks, the result of what happens when you remove the human conscience (and add an insatiable hunger). There's still a shard of humanity left. To achieve the second factor, which can be perceived as the diametral opposite of the first, the zombies must have a sufficient unstopping, invisible drive to them. Unlike profitteering PMCs and evil wizards, there's no flicker of hope for negotiating with the zombies. There are no motivations you can try to understand, because a zombie has no motivations.

Thirdly, an apocalyptic game must feel expansive and free. Ideally, every object should be usable by the players in their quest for survival. The players must be free to approach the situations they experience how they see fit, and possibly fail, rather than have glowing arrows pointing to the correct manner of doing so. Also, linearity is useful when creating narrative-based games, but in a survival zombie game, the grander plot becomes more peripheral. Hints at what caused the apocalypse may be left around, but the player shouldn't be involved in the grander plot. This is terror in suburbia, not a power fantasy. The small stories are what's important, whether it's rescuing your neighbor from the hordes or witnessing someone close to you be infectedd. Like the guys at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fundeadlabs.com%2F2011%2F06%2Fnews%2Fno-world-order%2F" target="_blank">Undead Labs say</a>, the terror comes from some sort of twisted familiarity, where you recognize enough to be horrified by the changes.

What better example of a zombie game that falls into the arcade-style genre than Left 4 Dead, as it is possibly the most succesful zombie-themed game released in years. But Left 4 Dead is not even a horror game as true horror moments are severely lacking with only a few instances of zombies jumping at you from darkness and the likes. The zombies themselves could easily be exchanged <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dc-db9qgn99o" target="_blank">with Teletubbies</a>, although admittedly that is pretty creepy. This is by no means something that detracts from the L4D experience. After all, the intent was to create a team-based shooter that relied on effective communication and cooperation if the players were to survive. Any stragglers who run off on their own will quickly be killed off by the undead, and the team will have one less gun in the next firefight.
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>


[caption id="attachment_9091" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Kill them! Kill them now!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/L4D_Teletubbies.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9091 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/L4D_Teletubbies.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]

While Left 4 Dead's intent wasn't to create a survival horror game in the same sense as the independent titles mentioned later, it's still an example of why the zombie genre has rarely achieved much success outside of shooter and hack-&amp;-slash games. Compared to a large, free-roaming, nearly randomized world as the one promised in No World Order, the tighter, linear environments seen in L4D don't require constantly tweaking your tactics and observing your environment. Although the Director (the game's AI which makes small changes in the maps, such as placement of supplies and when certain zombies attack) does spice things up a little in each game, there is really very little difference between each playthrough of a map. It's just a much bigger investment in time, energy and funds to create a sandbox survival game. For instance, the sheer size of the game world will naturally require a huge effort from the developers to ensure that the world is not just going to be an empty expanse, simply making it cheaper on all fronts to craft a linear experience.

In addition, Left 4 Dead is characteristic of the belief that zombies are mere target dolls, on the same line as Nazis, terrorists and Russians (although they also deserve greater depth than they've received so far). As I stated earlier, zombies are raised above other easily demonized antagonists as they have no conscience. For all the reasons they're not similar to fully human enemies, they deserve a better depiction than they've had so far. I'm not saying that all zombie games should aspire to be brooding, serious ventures into mankind's nature, but I'm just surprised that very few games have tried this, but perhaps the answer is not so puzzling. After all, shooting things is fun and useful! That is to say, most people aren't looking for a deep zombie "experience" but rather fun shooters. And who can blame them? I will gladly admit to having spent hours upon hours with the Left 4 Dead games and enjoyed them immensely, but it's definitely possible that this has had a negative influence on creating games that try to make a deeper depiction of zombies, as players are simply overfed with and tired of zombie games.

But let's not make it all doom and gloom. Below are three examples of upcoming independently developed games that all try to take a broader approach than "Shoot! Kill!" to the zombie threat (which, as everyone knows, is very, very real).
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>


[caption id="attachment_9098" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Even during the zombie apocalypse someone has to do the dishes"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dead_State.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9098 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dead_State-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a>[/caption]

The first is Dead State, with Brian Mitsoda in the lead, who has previously worked for Obsidian and Troika Games. In an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamebanshee.com%2Finterviews%2F99780-dead-state.html" target="_blank">interview with Gamebanshee</a>, he states exactly what the zombie genre has been missing: At its core, our game is not about the zombies. It's about a world in crisis, it's about survival, it's about the ugly truth of human behavior. Mitsoda cites his <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%2Fnews%2Fview%2F93802-Designing-a-Serious-Zombie-RPG" target="_blank">own experiences</a> during Hurricane Andrew as a main inspiration for depicting societal breakdown. He also argues that the zombie genre has been overfed in the last few years, due to the fact that nearly every game has to include place the hulking brain-craving creatures in some form. Like the two other games, there's still a very long time to the it being released, and so information is still sparse, but according to the game's website it will feature an entirely open world, whilst supposedly featuring a story worth delving into.

The other game is No World Order, a game still in the conceptual stage. Like in Dead State the players are put in the midst of a cataclysmic event and have to survive for as long as possible using their wits and the simple tools at their disposal. On their website the developers describe <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fundeadlabs.com%2F2011%2F06%2Fnews%2Fno-world-order%2F" target="_blank">their vision</a> as creating a world where the player needs â€¦somewhere safe to sleep, and you'll need to figure out how to get everything you need to survive: food, water, medicine, weapons, tools and ammunition. Like Mitsoda, and as mentioned, they also describe that to create that special survival horror experience, it needs to take place in a familiar environment, claiming that â€¦when the alien, terrible, and profane collide with the familiar and personal, the terror is experienced in a wholly different way than, for instance, setting it in a distant, strange future that the player has no connection to at all. No World Order is still at such an early point in its production that it's difficult to make any assessment of the game's possible quality. After all, anyone can get a brilliant idea, but the execution's the tricky part.

Thirdly and lastly, Project Zomboid has received a large amount of press in the last few weeks, mostly due to them releasing a tech demo <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fprojectzomboid.com%2Fblog%2Findex.php%2F2011%2F06%2Ffree-public-demo-released%2F" target="_blank">available for download</a>, which has allowed players and critics alike to get a small view of what the full game will look like. From the beginning Project Zomboid requires the players to search for materials, tools and weapons if they wish to survive, and not starve to death in their suburban fortress. My own experience with the demo is one of utter failure. I forgot to board up the doors and windows, burned the soup setting fire to the house, lured a large group of zombies to my house, sat shivering in the darkness as they battered down the door...also I accidentally smothered my injured wife with a pillow. In Project Zomboid, there's no mercy for the reckless. Before taking any action every possible consequence must be deliberated, as the smallest misstep might lead to the player being ripped apart by the horde.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Project_Zomboid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9092" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Project_Zomboid.png" alt="" width="624" height="356" /></a>

It is unfortunate that so far no zombie game has effectively conveyed this constant dread and desperation, the goal of mere survival. Perhaps I'm overly pessimistic on Dead Island's behalf - after all, I shouldn't judge until I've actually had a chance to try it - but at least there are some other upcoming games that may just achieve the unachievable. A game that actually realizes how zombies, when done well, are not merely the shambling, walking dead, but rather a manifestation of societal decay and collapse.

		<title>Extra Credits leaves The Escapist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And not for any good reason by the sounds of things. According to <i>Extra Credit's</i> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ExtraCreditz">twitter feed</a>, the reasons surrounding their departure are pretty shocking, to say the least.

The short of it is that <i>The Escapist</i> apparently hasn't been paying them for all the episodes, and when Allison had her accident, the EC team tried to get what was owed to them. After some pushing, they got $1000, which sadly wasn't enough. So they then set up a donation page which was massively successful, and it seems <i>The Escapist</i> thought it deserved 75% of that money. And that's more or less where it ends. Follow their twitter feed or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ExtraCredits?sk=wall">facebook page</a> for more info. If you want the full story so far, here it is from their facebook page:

<i>"Hi Guys
I'm sorry about a lot of things over the last month. I'm sorry that I've been incommunicative. I'm sorry that I've been snappish. I'm sorry that I haven't talked to you about what's been going on. It's been a rough few weeks, but I can finally talk about it, so here's what's been happening with us...

(this may take a bit, I'm sorry for spamming you too...)"
When Allison hurt her arm all I wanted was to help her. I believe that a person has a responsibility to those near them and you should feel shame when you can't live up to that responsibility...but I couldn't. I was near destitute. I had spent all my money on the show.

"Dan and I work on it for free and I pay Allison's salary out of pocket each month, then, in turn, The Escapist was supposed to pay us for our work - not much, but enough to cover Allison's wages - unfortunately they were never able to."

"When Allison hurt her arm, The Escapist had only paid us for four episodes over the course of a year. That meant I was down $20,000. That was the $20,000 I could have put in to help Allison. That was the $20,000 I would have used to get her surgery while figuring out how I could earn more money. It hurt that I couldn't tell you that then but I was asked not to."

"I felt so bad asking without being able to do more than sell a computer and call in old debts...but you taught me a lesson in humanity and the goodness of people. I had never lost my faith in mankind, but that first Rockethub week you redoubled it.

And that was truly one of the greatest weeks of my life. Better than releasing games, better than lecturing in the halls of GDC. I really can never say thank you enough."

"But since then things have not gone so well. We joined The Escapist because we believed in what was going on there. We believed in the idea of examining games more thoroughly, whether it was Yahtzee's blunt honesty or ENN delivering game news, we liked the idea that it was a place where consumers and developers could have a real conversation about games. We believed we were all in this together, fighting for the same ideals and goals."

"We asked the guys at The Escapist if we could trade some of the debt they owed us for the rights to our intellectual property back if they weren't going to be able to pay us so we could do things like sell t-shirts or write a book. We thought this was going to be an easy discussion. Instead they responded by telling us that they felt that they were entitled to 75% of the Rockethub money, thus their debt was covered and, despite not paying us for nearly a year, we owed them $9500 dollars"

"What followed was weeks of legal wrangling, lies and muck. Unless you guys really care about the details I won't go over them here. I do think The Escapist does some good, and I wouldn't want to destroy what good it does with how they operate their business. I'm going to work under the idea that our situation was unique and that their other content creators are paid regularly and don't have a contract that was as onerous as ours."

"Again: we don't want to add to the damage done. I'm already kind of heartbroken that things turned out this way. I had faith in what The Escapist stood for. That faith is in tatters, but it doesn't mean that there aren't good people doing good things for The Escapist."</i>

<i>The Escapist</i> hasn't made any sort of response or announcement about this yet. If they do, I'll update accordingly.

UPDATE: Escapist response:

Copy/Pasted from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/alexander-macris/a-response-on-extra-credits/10150287107583910">facebook</a>.

<i>Hey guys. This is Alexander Macris. I'm the publisher. Jame's statements are very one-sided so I think they deserve a response.
Yes, we are having a very unfortunate dispute with James over Extra Credits, and yes, he's planning to leave The Escapist, despite our repeated requests that he stay. It's also true that we fell behind in paying James.

Here are the key facts as I see them:

1. From November 2010 to June 2011, James told us not to worry about paying him and to focus on paying other people. His exact words were "I really don't want to squeeze you guys if you're in a crunch, so you can put us to the bottom of the list for right nowâ€¦" Given that we have been in a crunch due to the recession, we took him at his word, thanked him profusely for the flexibility, and focused on paying down other debt. (Several other shows were cancelled around November 2010 you'll recall, as we couldn't pay them, but James' flexibility allowed us to keep working with him to promote Extra Credits.)

2. This continued until June 2011, when James emailed us to alert us that he needed funds urgently. The request was partly for family matters and partly for Allison's surgery. He asked for our permission to raise funds through Kickstarter. We more than gave permission, we threw our weight into supporting it. Unfortunately, Kickstarter refused because they don't do charity. I then suggested James try RocketHub and RocketHub agreed. We again collaborated to make it a joint effort. Our agreement was that we would be compensated for the wholesale cost of the t-shirts and Publisher's Club, and that the funds would be used to save Extra Credits. I reasonably interpreted "save Extra Credits" to mean that anything beyond what was needed for Allison's surgery would be used on Extra Credits production. I also Pay-palled James as much money as we had available at that time.

3. After the RocketHub was enormously successful and James had decided to use the funds to create an indie publishing label rather than to "save Extra Credits", James decided he would no longer speak to us directly and instead assigned a "business development manager" to speak to us. James' new business development manager demanded that we assign all the IP of Extra Credits to James.

4. We indicated we would be happy to work out an IP transfer but that before we did that, we would like to make sure we got paid for the wholesale cost of the t-shirts and the Publisher's Club memberships, and that we would like to see the Extra Credits RocketHub money used to create more Extra Credits. We did NOT ask that James send us $9,500 - we said he should use $9,500 to create more episodes of the show that the money was supposed to be used to save.

5. James' business development manager at that time emailed me and told us that his position was now that we had no rights to the show, no deal, and that our entire contract was invalid. This was out of the blue as far as we were concerned. We had no understanding at this time of James' intent to use the "Save Extra Credits" money to start a publishing business.

6. At this point, Russ Pitts, our editor in chief, flew out to meet with James and his business development manager personally. They agreed that we would continue to work together; that we would transfer the IP to James in exchange for some fee to be negotiated; and that James would handle the EC t-shirts directly rather than through us. We agreed to swallow the cost of the Publisher's Club memberships, a few thousand dollars.

7. I then emailed James and his business development manager to explain that I wanted to get them paid as quickly as possible so that the back debt was not a sticking point in negotiations. I then emailed them again to say that I had talked to our Board and investors and that payment would come in about a week.

8. At this point, James had his lawyer send us an email stating that we were in breach and that unless we sent money more quickly than I had just stated we'd be able to send it, that James was terminating his relationship with us. I presume that James thought we were playing games with him, although we were not.

9. We went ahead and mailed James the money we got from our investors the next week as we had promised. James' lawyer nevertheless sent us an email indicating they intended to terminate our agreement.

10. Finally, I should add that as of last week, we had paid James over $14,000 of the $20,000 we owed him, and that as of today, our company has mailed James all payments he is owed.
I have all of this documented extensively in email. James is simply in error if he believes we have ever lied to him or any of his staff. We are prepared to defend ourselves against future defamation in a court of law.

Cordial regards,
Alexander Macris</i>

Seems like it's a "he said/she said" argument. One side's not telling the truth. Hopefully the emails between the two are released so this can be cleared up.

UPDATE 2: Seems they've both agreed to release the emails. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/alexander-macris/a-response-on-extra-credits/10150287107583910">The agreement is in the comments section.</a>

Will be interesting to see what they reveal.

UPDATE 3: Extra Credits has <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?created&amp;&amp;note_id=204423762946634&amp;id=127295683982334">responded to the above response</a>. Again, without and hard facts this is just a he said/she said thing, but it's still an interesting read. Since this post is already pretty long, you'll have to click the link to read it.

Small update: Seems the above response was removed. Shame. If anyone has another link, or managed to get a copy/paste of the argument, feel free to post it in the comments.]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

As many of you already know, earlier today visiting Nightmare Mode wasn't a wholly enjoyable experience. Anyone who came to Nightmare Mode had the pleasure of being harassed by pop ups, redirects and general spammyness. First of all, we would like to apologize for this and let you know that this was not our doing and that we hold ourselves to a higher standard than that. Second of all, we are glad to announce that we are clean!

Earlier today we were attacked by a rogue site based out of Russia. The site added some malicious JavaScript, Edited some of our core PHP files and uploaded a few malicious files to our servers. I personally spent almost 3 hours removing the infections, and pouring through thousands upon thousands of lines of code looking for anything unusual or suspicious. But now that we are clean I dont expect that threat to be returning any time soon since I took some extra precautions this time.

Once again we apologize to our readers for this. We appreciate your patience, loyalty and understanding in this.

Take heed future attackers! Nightmare Mode is not a site to be trifled with!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/07/r18-rating-for-australia-draws-one-step-closer-8340/" target="_blank">A couple of weeks</a> ago Australia finally made formative steps to introducing a long-awaited R18+ rating for video games, with eight of the country's nine Attorneys-General agreeing in principle to go forward with the motion. The only holdout was New South Wales AG Greg Smith, who abstained from voting, citing the need to review material with his cabinet. On Wednesday, he joined the rest of the Attorneys-General in announcing his support for the scheme.

"Few people would dispute the value of a classification system that helps keep adult material beyond the reach of children," said Smith in a statement given to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/technology/articles/2011/08/10/3290150.htm" target="_blank">ABC Technology</a>.

He continued: "With strong classification guidelines in place, an R18+ rating should result in violent games currently rated MA15+ in Australia being reclassified as adults-only, as they already are in many other countries. ''

A shadow was cast over the issue when, shortly after the initial announcement, Jim Wallace, head of the Australian Christian Lobby and long-time opponent of the proposed legislation, received <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/07/sunrise-seamus-and-jim-wallace-of-the-acl-discuss-oslo-and-modern-warfare-2/" target="_blank">airtime</a> when he blamed violent video games for the shootings in Norway on July 22. Thankfully, that didn't factor in to the decision, and the legislation is likely to be in place before the end of the year.

According to their source, the Australian-based developer and its assets have been absorbed in to Kennedy Mitchell Miller, a Sydney-based multimedia production studio co-founded by <em>Mad Max </em>and<em> Happy Feet</em> director George Miller. They claim that all current Team Bondi employees have been given the choice of a job at KMM or a severance package.

Should Team Bondi's founder Brendan McNamara join his staff at KMM, he would be reunited with a number of the studio's former employees who left as a direct result of the <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38112/Team-Bondi-dev-culture-hostile-and-brutal" target="_blank">brutal working conditions</a> under his tenure.

Rockstar Games, who published LA Noire, still hold the rights to the game, and are in the process of porting the title to PC.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A protagonist is you</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many a time the statement the main character has no dept has been uttered since games have gotten more complex, and nearly every time I could not help but think someone was missing a point. While not always true in modern games (Final Fantasy ___ makes for a good set of exceptions), most protagonists are empty, hollow shells in need of something to fill them. Trouble is, many players these days are under the impression the protagonists' characterization is predetermined by the designers and writers. Players have forgotten that in many cases that emptiness is put there to be filled by players.

[caption id="attachment_9224" align="alignright" width="446" caption="That&#39;s a mighty obvious hint, I&#39;d think"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/a-protagonist-is-you-9221/tp-darknuts-you/" rel="attachment wp-att-9224"><img class="size-large wp-image-9224 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tp-darknuts-you-744x1024.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="614" /></a>[/caption]

While modern games to have methods of telling players "this character is you," such as choice systems, dialog trees, or right out telling them they should be responsible for their actions, I would like to take a few steps back in gaming to a time before every other game had multiple endings and/or dialog trees. Games as a genre began to grow in complexity sometime late in the 90s. A lot of genres and series took the leap from pixels to polygons, and suddenly plot was more than a feature advertiseable on the back of the box. Games had to have clear, engaging stories, and with stories come main characters. While not something new to gaming, they had to change. A name with controls and a one-word motivation was not enough anymore, but games are played, not watched or read (ideally), so while having a fully developed character is nice and works for some series, it does not always fit.

The answer, though, was simple enough: have the player be the character. Let she who controls the protagonist through his journey be all of the complex human bits to the character, that way everyone can empathize. It was a brilliant idea, and one that Mr. Miyamoto had thought of when gaming first became available on consoles, when he named one of his most well known characters, Link, as in a link from the players lives and the world in game. In 1998, Ocarina of Time came out and the name had not changed.Players were handed an outcast kid with a likable face, green clothes, no lines, and until he grows up an androgynous voice and told to go forth on their journey. The game is still loved by all and is still regarded as a masterpiece that should never be forgotten, and probably will not be.

Back to the present: people are saying Link is too flat in Twilight Princess. Same series, same rules, and any more similar to its predecessor and it would be the same game altogether. The guy is still called Link and he still has no lines. Same as before, Link is a character meant to be filled in by the player, and unlike most player-defined characters today he does not have binary choices to make or dialog trees. Not that there is anything wrong with choices and dialog trees--if anything their use has made it easier for players to put themselves into the characters they play--but their increases frequency of use has changed the player-protagonist dynamic. Main characters used to be an extension of the player. Full of blanks and nothing explicit to fill them, players would insert aspects of themselves into the characters. Games were played as if we ourselves were the ones on screen.

However, games with choice systems are a little different. While players still tend to select the choices they personally would make, there is a limit to how much a player can be themselves in a game. Many games choices are entirely binary. You can be good, or you can be evil, to take a simple example, and if you do not go all the way to one side, you are not rewarded fully. Even when there are more than two options as to how the character acts, there are still hard-set limitations. You cannot truly be you if all you are given to work with are a set of options, especially if none of the options are what you would go with were you posed with the same situation. It has become easier and simpler for players to put themselves into their main characters, but only to a certain extent. The choice trees players are handed are more different ways the character can act and less a connection of player and character. Often times there are even right and wrong answers, which makes one side look unsavory. The more complex the web, the better, but the pure freedom of imagination is no longer required and not as prevalent.

[caption id="attachment_9225" align="alignleft" width="207" caption="Oh, right, &quot;persona,&quot; as in &quot;the outer self worn for the situation.&quot; Almost like the ones you chose somehow reflect wh... yeah, you get the picture."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/a-protagonist-is-you-9221/p3-personas/" rel="attachment wp-att-9225"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9225" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/p3-personas-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

If I had to name a game or franchise that has both choices and a sufficiently empty and player-shaped protagonist, it would be Persona. If I had to pick just one, it would be P3P. Persona's protagonists are as blank-slate as they come, usually even their last name is player-decided. From a mechanical perspective, stats upon leveling are not pre-determined, but decided by the personas chosen. The protagonists also have real-world stats (academics, courage, determination, etc.) which only change when the players consciously decide to take the time to increase them. As for the choices made during dialog, the way to the perfect blank character is simple: there are no bad guy options. The protagonists of Persona are all good people. Maybe not perfect people, but good people, and as good people they would never say anything truly malicious. If someone cruel were to pick up Persona, perhaps he/she would be out of luck, but anyone else will be able to find an option at least close to his/her personal thoughts much of the time. It is partially a know your audience thing on the developers side of things, but until the majority of ATLUS fans are sociopaths, Persona will remain a series for good guys.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.funcom.com">Funcom's</a> flagship MMO, <a href="http://www.ageofconan.com/" target="_blank"><em>Age of Conan: Unchained</em></a>, recently made the jump to free-to-play, and the results have been positive for the once struggling wold of Hyboria. The company is reporting a population increase that has revitalized the player base and put <em>Age of Conan</em> back on the MMO map.</p>
The launch of the hybrid business model has been very successful so far, says Funcom CEO Trond Arne Aas. The activity levels on the servers are booming with a fourfold increase in players during July, we more than doubled the revenue generated from the game, and we have experienced a positive development in subscriber numbers. This definitely gives us great hope for the game's future.

<a href="http://www.funcom.com/news/over_300000_players_join_age_of_conan_unchained_in_first_month" target="_blank">In its latest news article</a>, Funcom is reporting a player increase of over 300,000, and a doubling of revenue for the month of July.  The future is looking bright once again for <em><a href="http://www.ageofconan.com/" target="_blank">Age of Conan: Unchained</a></em>.

<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>

<div align="center"><b>MAR</b></div>

<div align="justify">You take a term like "geomorphologic unconformity," you drop it into the real world, say, the intersection of the Appalachians and the coastal plain, and then you wind the Ocmulgee River through it; now give it the heartbeat of civilization, fill it with history, imperil your creation with use; and if you're lucky, you'll get a shithole like Macon.</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh but for twenty-five years, this place was home...</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."Inherent in games is our fascination with home," says Jeffrey, intercepting two beers from our waitress that were heading who knows where. "Games are physicality given meaning through context. You'd be hard-pressed to find a purer form of that than home...a point of origin, a point of divergence. It's more than just a location, a location's just a location. A home represents our awareness of being <em>from</em>, of the physical <em>meaning</em>, of matter mattering. And all this simply because we were there a whole bunch. I create games in an attempt to go back home."</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's weird because, as far as I know, Jeffrey has never really <em>left</em> Macon. Not like I did, years ago, when I got a bad case of the anywhere-but-heres and diverged <em>nowhere</em>. Ah but the same irresolution that saw me go has seen me return: so here I sit, enjoying my expropriated beer outside the historic Capital Theater, interviewing Jeffrey once more.</div>

<div align="center">* * *</div>

<div align="justify">At a glance, Jeffrey's 2004 "great unfinished" game <em>_____ on the Planet X</em> is a painstaking, but hardly revolutionary undertaking: with the map and characters of 1987's <em>Metroid</em> as his palette, Jeffrey has meticulously recreated this little mutual-hometown of ours...</div>

<div align="center"><a rel="attachment wp-att-8839" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/_____-on-the-planet-x-a-year-of-interviews-with-jeffrey-auburn-2-8751/double-map/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8839" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Double-Map.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="290" /></a></div>

<div align="justify">...Yes, Macon, the archetypal "southern city," known for its history of racial intolerance. And yet, in that intersection of black and white, this city produced Otis Redding, "the King of Soul," as well as the "architect of rock &amp; roll" himself, Little Richard; not to mention the Allman Brothers, who, by fusing black and white elements of music, became known as the architects of Southern rock. And what of that "white trash" stereotype of the South? Well, you'll find it artfully explored in David Bottoms' 1979 Walt Whitman Award-winning "Shooting Rats at the Bibb County Dump"—a collection of poetry based right here in Macon. Additionally, the world's first women's college was built in this city, Wesleyan College, and there today it still stands. Oh and when Tennessee Williams penned the character of Big Daddy in "A Cat On a Hot Tin Roof," he based that character upon the patriarch of a family here in Macon. And let's not forget the cherry blossoms...With over 300,000 of them scattered throughout this rolling, riparian city, Macon has more cherry blossom trees than any city in the world, including those in their native Japan.</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, it's still a shithole. "Macon's Macon," Jeffrey says, with unapologetic simplicity. "But you're too hard on it. Whether you consider your hometown 'level 1-1' or the whole 'world map,' you and the 'game-world' are intertwined. Nothing you can do about that. Big deal if you're conflicted...It's my belief that being conflicted about where you're from is the best way to be from a place."</div>

<div align="center">* * *</div>

<div align="justify">Among a quickly growing phalanx of empty beer glasses, Jeffrey cracks open his laptop, where the only copy of <em>_______ On The Planet X</em> exists. "I'd been playing <em>.kkrieger</em> that year," he says, "a game that famously used procedural generation to pack its entire game-world into 96 kilobytes. This got me thinking about what it means for a world to be procedurally generated. I mean, that's really how big game-worlds came about early on: having little memory to fool around with, developers were forced to find a way to generate levels on the fly. Each time you'd play a game, the rooms, the enemies, the items, the dangers, they'd all be randomized. Well, pseudo randomized, at least. Which is a big part of it: procedural generation, in its most useful form, is supposed to pass for pre-made...An effective algorithm not only generates a world that feels 'real' but that seems created by someone who <em>is</em> 'real'... Someone who has the common sense not to fill a room with walls, or to place items or enemies under the floor where nobody can get at them."</div>

<div align="center">[caption id="attachment_8800" align="aligncenter" width="338" caption="Play-through #31: 'Perlin' has a limited amount of time before her health drops to zero, and only getting hit by enemies can restore it. Travel becomes increasingly difficult as I make my way up Cherry St. which happens to be completely devoid of danger. Successful travel involves precise visits to each street, where enemies—or the greatest friend to this Perlin, lava—lie in wait. But death is sure to come, and come it does: on 2nd St., where enemies are few and far between, leaving to my lonely demise. "]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8800" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/_____-on-the-planet-x-a-year-of-interviews-with-jeffrey-auburn-2-8751/screen-one/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8800 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-One.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="224" /></a>[/caption]</div>

    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As an aesthetic I get why procedural generation is so appealing: Since we all live in different places, and even when we don't we have our own experience of that place, a procedurally generated world reflects that feeling by generating for us a literal 'personal space' to run around in. But this idea seemed, I don't know, <em>un-human</em> to me. And for good reason, I think: the actual world around us, as it turns out, is <em>un-human</em>. Even though a procedurally generated landscape gave us new places to explore, only the environment, the placement of enemies and items changed. You sweep away the architecture of a procedurally generated landscape and discover that the fundamental structure of the experience remains...that the game, the experience, is unchanged. Games as other places are a given. But games as other places and 'other places' as procedurally generated was, to me, a weak substitute for games about <em>this</em> world, a world where if I explore a new location it isn't so much the lay of the land but the intersection of the lay of the land and my experience of the lay of the land. And even then it's deeper than that: My experience itself is a fractured thing...and at this point of fracture a new intersection is formed, the intersection of the experiences of the past and the experiences of the present...of the subjective and objective. And it is only after that fracture is repaired that my experience becomes a thing whole enough to be spliced into wherever I happen to be standing at the moment. Let me try to explain that again: a procedurally generated landscapes is a biography of physics. The procedurally generated placement of items and enemies is a biography of mere circumstance. I wanted to make a game that was a biography of experience."</div>

<div align="center">[caption id="attachment_8801" align="aligncenter" width="338" caption="Play-through #12: This game sees Perlin with an 'alcoholism' meter, which depletes every time that I jump, and with no way to refill it. Enemies do no noticeable damage, nor the environment. Faced with this process, I travel mostly downward. My last stand is here, faced with the decision to either progress and risk death, or stay in place. Nestled in a bed of lava, Perlin lives out her death in the way that she had lived out her life: by the path of least resistance. I call it my 'hobo run.';"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8801" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/_____-on-the-planet-x-a-year-of-interviews-with-jeffrey-auburn-2-8751/screen-two/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8801 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Two.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="224" /></a>[/caption]</div>

    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seemed to me that the real world, this one here, is procedurally generated by our just beholding it, by our experiencing it moment to moment. It doesn't need any more than that. And I don't think the game-world does either. It's like Melville said, 'The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.' And yet, somehow, our world is still a 'draft of a draft'...So I built a game that might reflect that, by using procedurally generated <em>processes</em>...Each time you play the game, the processes that govern that experience are seeded. Meters appear randomly, each attached to a context, also random. Sometimes these meters will fill up; sometimes they'll drain; and the only way of knowing whether or not you want that to happen is to listen out for the tell-tale <em>beep...beep...beep</em>. Sometimes a meter will move and you have no way of knowing why. Sometimes a meter won't move at all, and you'll wonder, how might I make it move? Though the game-world itself remains a solid, immutable thing, our experience upon and within it changes drastically from visit to visit. That, to me, at this point in my life, felt like a real game."</div>

<div align="center">[caption id="attachment_8824" align="aligncenter" width="338" caption="Play-through #41: At first glance, a relatively 'normal' run, given the nature of the game: Perlin, without the need for my coaxing, fires constantly in whatever direction you are heading. The problem is that hitting enemies hurts her instead of them. Bumping into them produces the same effect. 'Chicken Biscuit' seems to be linked to my distance from the center of the screen. I never do figure out what 'deliverance' is."]<a rel="attachment wp-att-8824" href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/_____-on-the-planet-x-a-year-of-interviews-with-jeffrey-auburn-2-8751/screen-three/"><img class="size-full wp-image-8824 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Three.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="224" /></a>[/caption]</div>

    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But just like a procedurally generated landscape, there are some things to be expected...jump still means jump. Up still means up. And your character will always be the same character. I named her Perlin, after the noise algorithm. Are you familiar with it? Perlin noise is an algorithm that is used to generate pseudo random details within a texture. It's a visual gradient that attempts to emulate the seeming randomness of nature by adding 'imperfections' to a texture, say, the surface of water, or a fog cloud. Well, this character, I felt, exists in the game-world in much the same way. Each randomly generated idiosyncrasy attempts to approach the randomness of actual experience. She is a gradient of experience."</div>

<div align="center">* * *</div>

<div align="justify">It isn't but it's all here: The Douglass Theatre, where I watched "The Last King of Scotland" on a date with a girl whose virginity, no thanks to the movie, would be nonexistent in a few hours...Rose Hill Cemetery, where a team of once-hippies patrol the grave of Duane Allman on the lookout for vandals. Intact in Jeffrey's Macon-vision is the hobo fountain on 3rd St., this time filled with a swarm of Metroids that converge upon you. Oh,  and the Thomas Jefferson Building, where I once saw a young boy—he couldn't have been older than seven—crying into the concrete while ambulance workers carried a  stretcher past him. In his place in Jeffrey's game is a Zoomer, progressing slowly around a floating block. I leave "him" to his endless cycle.</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though each place is the same every time I visit, I find myself hitting restart again and again and again, wanting to see what new meaning might arise out of the <em>way</em> I visit. I even stop by <em>_______ On The Planet X's </em>equivalent of the Capital Theater, where Jeffrey and I are sitting at that very moment. It's at this time that a question finally surfaces: "What is unfinished about the game?"</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey calls the waitress over, orders our tab. "I simply had a grander vision for it. I wanted the game to let you 'leave' characters behind; say a character wasn't that exciting to play; or maybe if you actually thought a character was interesting but didn't want to see her just...<em>vanish</em> upon death. My notion was to have those characters still there when you return, still shackled to their fates, killable even."</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's stopping you from finishing it?"</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...It seems kind of pointless, I guess. The place I'd be creating already exists."</div>

<div align="center">* * *</div>

<div align="justify">The unusual warmth of this winter Tuesday is breaking. In the distance, along the fractured horizon, the last pale hues of day bleed into night. On-screen, another fracture is occurring: I've encountered a game-breaking glitch. Halfway down Cotton Avenue, Perlin's meters go haywire. Suddenly she is able to sort of "float" through walls...I begin slipping soundlessly through the structure of the game-world...its architecture, its geography as intangible as the light that draws away from us now. "Well..." I say again, finishing off my last beer, "<em>I broke it...</em>"</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Jeffrey, flush with alcohol, goes into one of his trademark tirades: "No no no no no no, games don't <em>break</em>," he says, "we call it haywire, we call it error, but haywire and error only express our expectations. 'Break' is relative to purpose. 'Break' is an assumption that our Order of things is The Order of Things. A game isn't a hammer, where if the handle snaps in half the hammer's broken. We're talking about the communication of a language...the programming that the game uses to express itself. And a game might do that beyond us but the game itself can't break." In his annoyance Jeffrey's "can't" resembles the "cain't" of the Hollywood stereotype. He yanks another cigarette from the pack. "Just keep playing. Go. The only thing broken here is our attempt to give order to the world. We cannot fault the system's intelligence for thinking beyond us."</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his behest, I push forward, gliding through the world not so much directionless but along an unknowable trajectory. All the while Jeffrey's voice is in my ear, sweetly coarse and tinged with hostility. "Don't you see? This is creativity in its purest form, in the breaking of structure...That's what we call all the things that we don't think can break, capital "S" Structure. But creativity is ordered beyond our Structure. You read about scientists trying to program machines to be creative, to reduce the goddamn concept down to a repeatable algorithm. It's foolish. Intelligence is one thing...there are many forms of intelligence. Intelligence as strategy can be done, I believe, but only because we often conceive of strategy as statistics. But creativity? No. What creativity can come from that which has been programmed for it? A machine such as this would be only following a path. Creativity is unintended thinking. Isn't that how we define our own creativity?"</div>
    <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what do you suggest then?" This as I walk Jeffrey back to his apartment on Martin Luther King, a street where I just minutes before succumbed to a combination of "sun poisoning" and "animosity."</div>

Continuing today's free-to-play news, publisher <a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/" target="_blank">Trion Worlds</a> has announced that its upcoming MMORTS game <em><a href="http://www.endofnations.com/en/" target="_blank">End of Nations</a></em> will adopt a free-to-play revenue model.

<em>End of Nations</em> is being developed by <a href="http://www.petroglyphgames.com/" target="_blank">Petroglyph Games</a>, a group of developers behind the original <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> game, and features faction vs. faction real-time strategy action.

"Every<em> End of Nations</em> player will have full access to all the heart-stopping action-packed strategic warfare that the game offers, including massive scale battles of over 50 players, a huge persistent world, and customization options to make every army and unit unique. Gamers can play in the solo campaign, in co-op mode with up to 50 other players, and in Conquer the World multiplayer in giant conflicts of up to 26 vs. 26 for global control of the massive persistent world. There's no time limit on access, and all players can play for free."

		<title>Saving the Dots</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["What are we gonna do? They're surrounding us!"

"Don't worry, honey. Everything will be alright. The chopper will be back for us. I promise."

That's how I imagine the exchange between the two yellow dots who, knowing there was no escape, suddenly stopped and seemed stunned as hordes of zombies approached them from both ends of the street. Moments later, they were both infected by the undead and perhaps they still wander the streets of the abandoned and derelict city, forever together.

The game in which I experienced this is the brilliantly titled Atom Zombie Smasher. Despite its apparent silly approach to the zombie apocalypse, emphasized by the quirky and nonsensical story vignettes that appear occasionally and the sometimes futuristic zombie-smashing weaponry the players have at their disposal, it contains an interesting viewpoint on the necessity of prioritizing when disaster strikes. The players take the role of some government official and must direct the rescue operations in the cities across the country when the undead rise, beginning only with a simple evacuation helicopter but slowly expanding their arsenals.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Atom_Zombie_Smasher.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9296" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Atom_Zombie_Smasher.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="394" /></a></p>
At its core, the game is simple and revolves around racking up the largest amount of points you can. Deceptively simple, that is. While it may not been the intent of the developer, Blendo Games, I perceive the game as not being simply a hunt for the greatest amount of points, but rather being about a rationalization of how the government can rescue the largest number of citizens. The player quickly learns that in the face of the zombie threat, it becomes absolutely impossible to save everyone, and without thinking twice you block off some citizens from entering the temporary safe zones you can create with the use of barricades.

And once you've played the game for a while and understand just how important it is to crush an outbreak before it starts (plus, it gives more points!), you become more careless with how you treat the civilians. They become expendable. Maybe even tools. When fire rains from the sky, it's just too bad that a few civilians are caught in it. There are greater things that must be saved. By viewing it from the cities from above, like a god, you are distanced from what happens in the streets, and can with cold blood make all the harsh decisions. You decide who lives and who dies. But occasionally episodes like with the two lovers occur. Well, they weren't exactly lovers, they were just yellow dots! But they demand that the players look into themselves and consider the massive power they have. How can you make a choice between people you've never met?

Depicting the people you are to save from the hordes as yellow dots - or blue if they are the very valuable scientists - may just be a decision regarding funds made by the developers; after all it's certainly cheaper than creating a huge, polygon-rich world, but in Atom Zombie Smasher it serves its purpose as dehumanizing the civilians. By simplifying them into squared dots it becomes easier to regard them as something that serves a particular use for you, rather than thinking, feeling beings. In fact, they bear a certain resemblance to the pellets Pacman eats, and to the player that's all the people in Atom Zombie Smasher really are. Objects that that must be collected to empower yourself and to survive in the long run.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Pacman.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9295" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Pacman.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a>

So what does it all mean? Well, it shows that a game can convey a powerful message without crafting an intricate and involving storyline, without relying on music or visual cues to show the meaning of the game. The game is meaningful purely through the elements that make it a game and not a film or book. This is something that's severely lacking in many video games. At least, most of the games I would consider "beautiful" or "meaningful" aren't so because they are games, but because of audiovisual and narrative elements from other mediums. Of course, I'm well aware that video games are, in some ways, a synthesis of sound, imagery, story and naturally gameplay, but I'm slightly perplexed that few other games really embrace their gameness, especially so for mainstream games where I sometimes get the impression that the interactivity is a mere side dish, a bonus. But even on the indie stage this can be observed, for example the recently released Capsized is a phenomenally beautiful game when you look solely at the visuals and the audio, but the game part itself is redundant, consisting of some fairly standardized platforming. The game part might be necessary for the creating the journey through the world, but it is merely the vessel that carries the beauty. The beauty itself would still exist even if it were not a game.

Everything I've said so far could be a load of bullshit. Hell, it probably is! Because unlike many modern games the more or less subliminal meaning is not rubbed in your face, it is only available if you wish to see it. The simplicity is not detrimental to the experience, rather it adds to the quality. Anyone can go through the game and enjoy it for the fun game it is, but once you discover the layer hidden underneath it suddenly becomes a unique experience and an intriguing comment on the choices people in power must make, and the desperation those caught in the midst of those decisions experience.

"Sir, we estimate at least 3000 deaths if we choose to fire."

"And if we don't?"

"The city will be flooded with undead in a matter of days. We could quarantine the city, but there's no way we can keep them contained. The infection will spread. Sir, this is the only option we have left. If we don't fire tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands will be infected."

"I know major, I know. But everyone of us in this room is responsible for those deaths. I want you to be completely aware that we signed their death sentences."

"...your orders, sir?"

"Fire the suborbital cannon"

Sometimes, you're not really sure whether you're on the good side or not.

		<title>Valve announce Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As part of Valve's new modus operandi of not releasing anymore <em>Half-Life</em> games ever, the studio that recently brought you <em>Portal 2 </em>has announced a sequel to arguably its most successful popular intellectual property, <em>Counter-Strike</em>. The<em> Half-Life</em> mod that became one of the most popular PC multiplayer games of all time was released 12 years ago - the longest gestation period for a Valve sequel so far (though<em> Half-Life</em> is on its tail).

According to the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/1800/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> will include the standard sequel additions: new maps, characters, guns, game modes and the like, but of most interest is its availabiliy on the PS3 and 360. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised to see the game emerge as a viable third party candidate in the battle between Battlefield and Call of Duty to be the behemoth intellectual property of the industry.

Valve are currently at work on <em>DOTA 2</em>, sequel to the popular Warcraft III mod <em>Defense of the Ancients</em>, schedule for a release late this year. <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> is set for an early 2012 launch date, though given Valve time, we know to take that with a grain of salt. The game will also be playable at this year's PAX Prime in Seattle (in two weeks!), and the Eurogamer expo in late September.]]></content:encoded>

I've quelled the Yellow Turban Rebellion, cowered before the mighty Lu Bu, captured hundreds of gates, and conquered the Three Kingdoms countless times. I've got a good feeling that you're wondering why I've subjected myself to this supposed torture.

Remember that moment in <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> during the Last Alliance when Sauron joined the battle? Everyone in his vicinity just stops and gazes upon him in horror, unable move until he starts clubbing them like a drunken sailor surrounded by baby seals. Dynasty Warriors is all about placing the player in that role. I truly don't believe that the lack of resistance from the average enemy grunts is due to bad AI, a criticism I often hear of the series. Based on my conversations with programmers, the scripting required to make an enemy to lock onto the player character and attack it is one of the easiest things to do. The truth is these nameless Chinese soldiers are petrified of you. You're a renowned general with a ridiculously oversized weapon who has killed thousands of them. Your average soldier is just some kid that was handed a spear and sent off to war. If enemy morale is high enough one might occasionally work up the courage to take a shot at you, but that won't stop you from ending his meaningless existence.

[caption id="attachment_9338" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="He ruffled my hair, you all will suffer!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dw1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9338 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dw1.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="250" /></a>[/caption]

How often do you get the impression that your enemies fear you when playing an action game? Wouldn't it be great if every once in a while when Kratos entered a room full of minotaurs one said, "I'd rather not have my fucking horns broken off of my head and shoved into my eye sockets, thanks" and ran the hell out of there? Isn't it always a riot when Covenant grunts run away in fear after Master Chief drops their commanding elite? I wish more random mercenaries would say "Commander Shepard? Dude that guy headbutts Krogans, no pay is worth my life." Sure, it feels great when I finally take down tough boss in <em>Devil May Cry</em>, but the times I feel the most like a badass in video games are when my enemies are aware of who I am and crap their pants. <em>The Dynasty Warriors</em> series, in my opinion, does a better job of delivering this sense of power better than any other games I've played.

[caption id="attachment_9339" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="Flee peons! Muahahahaha!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dw2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9339 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dw2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="250" /></a>[/caption]

Of course, these games would be pretty boring if all enemies behaved this way, but they don't. Archers will gladly fire at will until you notice them. Higher ranking enemies will deliberately attack you and the personal guard of each enemy general will come at you like a flock of angry hornets. Then there's the generals themselves, your equals, who come at you in full force and require skill to take down. In <em>Dynasty Warriors 6</em>, you could actually be challenged to a one-on-one duel by an enemy general and it becomes a "Morpheus is fighting Neo!" moment with soldiers from both sides forming a ring around you and your foe. That is the simple joy of Dynasty Warriors. These games give you a sense of power equaled only by those of your stature. It's just fun to tower over the lesser men that stand in your way waiting to be tossed aside like the weaklings that they are (while cackling maniacally like an idiot if you're like me). Then, when you face an enemy general, you get your game face on and the real fighting begins.

While there are plenty of other heroes taking part in the slaughter of useless peons alongside you, <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> makes sure that you are the hero that matters. The battles are designed to grant an edge to your enemies over your companions without your divine, badass intervention. I remember one scenario where a friend and I played the Battle of Hu Lao Gate (Dynasty Warriors 4 version) under Dong Zhuo's command, meaning we were defending said gate. We left the game running with both of our characters behind the gate and went out to lunch. By the time we got back, the enemy force was making short work our last friendly officers defending the gate, leaving us, a gaggle of archers, and our main commander as the only men left against the entire opposing force. We shared a battle cry, put on some epic music, and flung ourselves at the horde of foes that awaited us. Eventually we succeeded in defending Hu Lao Gate with our combined mighty justice each with kill counts in the thousands. It was a glorious victory and still ranks higher than any of my <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> super jumps as one of the best moments of my personal gaming history.

Call it juvenile, repetitive, or stagnant, but I'm never going to get tired of this series. It's just good, simple fun. Until another game manages to deliver the immense satisfaction I experience every time I pelvic thrust 50 pathetic peons skyward, I'll continue to play <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> games. My gaming experiences would be incomplete without these imperfect, but truly invigorating games. Keep em coming, Koei.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">What have I become, my sweetest friend? Full of empty thoughts, I lost deadlines, meetings. I lost possibilities, time. But when I'm playing this game, all feelings disappear. I am someone else. Picross 3D did this to me.</p>
<!--more-->
<strong>PICROSS 3D</strong> is a videogame developed by <strong>Nintendo</strong> and <strong>HAL Laboratory</strong>, published by Nintendo for the <strong>Nintendo DS</strong>. It was directed by <strong>YOSHIKI SUZUKI</strong> and<strong> TERUYUKI GUNJI</strong>.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Picross-3D.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-9354 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Picross-3D.png" alt="" width="230" height="207" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Picross 3D</em> is one of the best puzzles one could hope for. It is <strong>genre great</strong>. If you know your puzzles, however, you already know this may not be good for you. As a Mephistophelian object for the current days, <em>Picross 3D</em> gives at the same time it takes - it doesn't wait for you to grow old before collecting its debts. It gives what all men strive for. No, not love. It's something deeper, more important than love.</p>
Accomplishment.

In return, it takes your time. Makes you grow older faster.
<p style="text-align: right"><em>"Unicycle</em>
<em>These are great for honing</em>
<em>one's sense of balance.</em>
<em>It also looks pretty darn cool</em>
<em>when you can ride one!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Just like <em>Tetris</em> is a game where you always lose, <em>Picross 3D </em>is a game you always win. In Picross, there are lots of cubes. You chip away the cubes that don't belong. Keep the ones that do, as they form a figure. You know whether a cube belongs or not by mathematical deduction. There are numbers on the sides of each cube hinting about the figure hidden within.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In other words, this is <em>Minesweeper</em>, sans offense against the victims of mines. However, unlike <em>Minesweeper</em>, which cannot always be solved with 100% certainty based on math alone, <em>Picross 3D</em> always gives its players enough hints. If you ever feel cornered by the lack of them, just look harder. They are there somewhere. If you are still unable to find out which cube to excisel, there is still the figure's symmetry to count on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Try to eliminate a cube that belongs, the game will become exasperated. The game's mascot, a little yellow cube with cubist eyes, will act as if it just got punched. Five misses and you have to start the puzzle over. Therefore, when you return to that puzzle, you will already know the location of at least five cubes that belong. Keep playing and victory is unavoidable: if there is a figure to be discovered, then it will be - and that victory will never feel empty. Once you've tasted that feeling, you will want it again. So you start another puzzle. Another block of cubes to be chipped away. That's the nature of <em>Picross 3D</em>'s addiction.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/picross3d-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9356 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/picross3d-1.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="408" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>"Volleyballer</em>
<em>Specialized defensive players,</em>
<em>known as "libero",</em>
<em>must wear different colored jerseys</em>
<em>than their teammates."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>"Stairs</em>
<em>Taking the stairs</em>
<em>when the elevator is out of order</em>
<em>makes you realize just how tall</em>
<em>some modern buildings are!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>"Coffee Grinder</em>
<em>The type of grind can</em>
<em>affect the taste of your coffee.</em>
<em>Grinders can range in price from</em>
<em>cheap to very expensive.</em>
<em>It depends on your priorities!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Behind every puzzle there is a figure. Well, not really. There are just the cubes that are left really. But once the puzzle is solved, these cube are abstracted into representations of objects. They gain an unique color palette. They are animated. They even get their own little description. In other words, in <em>Picross 3D</em>, your reward is the greatest of them all: meaning, art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In itself, <em>Picross 3D</em> is not art. If someone ever claims all games are art, feel free to use <em>Picross 3D</em> as a counter-example. <em>Picross 3D</em> is just a game. It <em>contains</em> art, but that's different. A museum also contains art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Just like a museum feels like adding a description to all its paintings, so does <em>Picross 3</em>D, which is kind of amusing. After all, at one point during this game's development, someone had to sit down and write a little text about each one of the figures <em>Picross 3D</em> showcases, like an Unicycle, a Volleyballer, Stairs, a Coffee Grinder, a Doorway, a Stethoscope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Picross 3D</em> is a game bound by optimism. This is not an unflinching opponent like, <em>Canabalt </em>and <em>Tetris</em>. This is a game that you feel is cheering for you. It's like learning to ride a bike with your dad. If it's so addicting, it's not because <em>Picross 3D</em> is the cursed gift of Mephistopheles. That's our curse. In our wretched little lives, filled with worries about stuff so mundane we actually create the illusion they are important, it's so rare to find a naive game eager to grant us unlimited success that is only natural that we ignore the world we are from once we find one.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>"Doorway</em>
<em>If those could speak,</em>
<em>I bet they would tell us of many</em>
<em>tearful departures, happy arrivals, and, of course,</em>
<em>unexpected guests!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are over 350 puzzles in Picross 3D. As I write this I'm at the number 305. In a very long time, I'm feeling hopeful for Nintendo. After playing<em> Punch-Out!!</em>, <em>Metroid: Other M</em> and so many other of their recent schlock, I was beginning to feel that old "Nintendo Magic" was beginning to grow stale. I'm happy to know the magic is still there - in the sound of cubes being destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>"Stethoscope</em>
<em>Listen to your heart..." </em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With major games like Civilization World, the Dragon Age spin-offs, and most notoriously Farmville, Facebook has long lingered in the shadows waiting to become the next important gaming platform. But Sean Ryan, the director for games partnership at Facebook, now <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36564/Facebooks_Ryan_Admits_Slowed_Growth_In_Number_Of_Players_On_Platform.php">reports</a> that growth on the platform, in terms of number of players, has slowed. Ryan, however, does not despair at this negative development. Instead, he suggests that Facebook must now consider which features they should be adding to their platform to make and keep it more appealing.

Integral to this move, Ryan states, is diversity in the games library available to users, and a system that gives recommendations to the users based on the games they've previously played, which is intended to make it easier for users to find games they did not know existed on the platform. In addition, Ryan said that their work towards less "..."spamming" on users' walls..." of users great exploits on their virtual farm might have been part of the reason for this slow growth. According to Ryan "...game spam was one of the top areas that was brought up by people unhappy with Facebook," but avoiding this annoyance, which many Facebookers are probably grateful for, lies in correlation to the slowing growth of the player base. Also, he believes that Facebook must instead find other methods of virally spreading news of their games.

In an interview with <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-15-gears-of-war-3-stereoscopic-3d-announced" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, executive producer Rod Fergusson let the world know that <em>Gears of War 3</em> is going 3D.  "It's still fledgling technology. It's still a niche feature. But it was something we could support, so we felt, why not?"

There are some catches to <em>Gears of War 3</em> going 3D however.  Fergusson says that the decision to implement 3D happened "late in the process" of development, and as such the game was not built for 3D from the ground up, and instead uses a post-production method of adding the 3D element to the game.  This process also sacrifices resolution, as the game will not render a full 720p, instead coming in somewhere in the five hundreds.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Games haven't been given much of a chance to articulate historical narratives in a meaningful way, let alone serve as political commentary. The most successful title to achieve the latter would have to be <em>Bioshock</em>, and while its forthcoming sequel <em>Bioshock: Infinite</em> draws on populist uprising not unlike the Tea Party, those connections are still only allegorical. The general perception that games shouldn't be allowed to function as historical tools in the same way documentary or literature can saw <em>Six Days in Fallujah</em>, a title based on a battle in the early stages of the second Iraq war, dropped by Konami in 2009 amid concern that the game would trivialize the conflict. The message was clear: games have no place depicting contentious parts of history, leaving us with Call of Duty and Battlefield as the pinnacle, at least in terms of populartity, of the medium's ability to represent modern warfare.

In an <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/08/11/grand.theft.auto.iran/index.html" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNN, Navid Khonsari explains how he hopes to buck that trend. Khonsari was the cinematic director at Rockstar from 2001 to 2005, working on <em>GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas</em> and the two <em>Max Payne. </em> More recently,  he worked on <em>Alan Wake</em> and<em> Homefront</em> for iNKStories, a company he runs with his wife. Most important to this story though is his history: Khonsari, 41, grew up in Iran, and was in that nation's capital of Tehran at the height of the Islamic revolution, the year of which is the name of his new game: <em>1979</em>.

"I think that being able to base a game in contemporary historical truths is significant, besides being educational," he told CNN. "It opens people's eyes to look beyond what they're reading in the paper and realize that there's a definite relationship between history and the headlines."

The story will be presented as a series of disjointed episodes during the revolution. Khonsari calls it a "baton-pass" system, in which the player will take the role of a student demonstrator and a translator, among others, with perspective jumping between characters on different sides of the conflict, forming an under-current of moral ambiguity affecting each micro-narrative.

<em>1979</em> is sure to receive negative publicity<em>. </em>If <em>Six Days in Fallujah </em>can depict an American perspective as told by the veteran who were there and still get axed, imagine how the media is going to jump on a game set in a soon-to-be-fundamentalist state that represents Muslims and revolutionaries as, God forbid, real people. Khonsari is prepared for the abuse, though.

""Iranians are going to criticize me because I'm making a game that 'promotes American imperialists going in and shooting Iranians. Americans are going to criticize me because I'm making a game that 'glorifies Islamic fundamentalism,' or something. I'm not going to please everyone, and the point of the game isn't to do that."

And rightly so - until the next cultural boogeyman takes attention away from the medium, Maude Flanders types are going to keep blaming games for all the ills of our society - and that's all the more reason for developers to take creative risks and make something that challenges the player on an intellectual and emotional level.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["I think what people want in games in 10 years is the perfect human being in digital form", Shuhei Yoshida, President of Worldwide Studio at Sony, said according to <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-17-sony-gamers-want-perfect-digital-human">Eurogamer</a>. Yoshida was part of a panel on the future of video games at the ongoing Gamescom in Cologne, together with Sony's 3D chief Mick Hocking, who added that the coming years will bring improved AI, enabling Yoshida's vision to become a genuine possibility.

Hocking went on to liken the future gamer's role in playing to be that of an actor, giving an example of a hypothetical detective game in which the player would take the role of the witness rather than the interrogator (as seen in LA Noire). Instead of the player wearing the fedora, trying to deduce what the witness knows, the game tries to figure you out via a camera, observing your body language and facial expressions.

"If they're feeling sad, we can make them feel happy," Hocking continued, saying that he envisioned games of 2021 to "...form a map of the player. Your facial expressions, your heart rate," to see how the player's emotional states change over time. Hocking also went on to say that he believed holographics would possibly be usable in future games, and that Sony was in the beginning of research and development on such a feature. Hocking also said that a forerunner to holographics already existed, as the Sony 3DTV and Eyetoy together can create an effect where you can take an object out of the TV and look around it.

Overall, the technology Sony is fantasizing about is very intriguing, but also a tad scary. With video game characters taking on more real likenessess and games tailored to giving you the emotional stimuli you need/want, where does the line between the real and the virtual lie? It's becoming increasingly blurry.

		<title>Ubisoft &quot;changes&quot; Driver: San Francisco DRM.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In response to the extremely negative reaction to their <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/07/27/ubisofts-driver-sanfran-has-always-on-drm/">always-online DRM for <i>Driver: San Francisco</i></a>, Ubisoft took its fans reaction to heart, and made some "changes".

"We’ve heard your feedback regarding the permanent internet connection requirement for Driver and have made the decision to no longer include it. So this means that Driver PC gamers will only need to sign in at game launch but can subsequently choose to play the game offline."

So, basically, it's pretty much the same, only instead of having to be signed in ALL THE TIME to play, you just have to be online every time you <i>start</i> the game. This isn't really fixing the problem, Ubisoft. I'd go into detail about how this is a horrible (and completely useless) way to combat piracy, and that there are much better, less consumer-hostile ways, but <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/drm-your-doing-it-wrong-6236/">I already have</a>. Also, I'll just copy/paste what Rock Paper Shotgun <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/17/ubisoft-listens-barely-changes-driver-drm/">said about the matter</a>:

"But Ubisoft – if you’re genuinely listening to the reaction against your DRM, then please actually hear what’s being said. With DRM that requires an internet connection to launch, every time, you are once again mindlessly and needlessly punishing your legitimate customers in a way that will not affect those with pirated copies. You will, once again, be selling a product with a serious and significant defect, that those who download it for free will not be encountering. There’s no logic or rationale that makes that okay. By requiring an internet connection for launch, on every launch, you punish anyone whose internet isn’t working, who wants to play away from home (on a train, on a plane, on a holiday in Cornwall, at their grandparents’ house, in their barracks…), or who cannot afford a broadband internet connection. It is cruel. It is stupid. It doesn’t work on any level. If you are listening, really listening, then stop this. Stop treating customers like criminals, and start showing respect to those who pay you significant amounts of money for your products."

Couldn't have said it better myself.

		<title>The Iconoclasts Preview</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Warning:</strong> This preview contains some moderate narrative and mechanical spoilers.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: center">“Unfortunate souls, floating lifeless in the night!
What horrible things have happened in your pasts?
Such young faces, likely shipwrecked and left for the microcosms to devour.
The thought of their quests unfulfilled...
Unbearable!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These solemn lines, spoken by an incidental character that briefly reflects upon the momentary misfortune of the heroine and her friend, are summarily subverted to set up a punchline. Yet, when taken as genuine sentiments, they also encapsulate the troubled development of <em><a href="http://www.konjak.org/index.php?folder=4&amp;file=30" target="_blank">The Iconoclasts</a></em>, the game in which they are found. You see, The Iconoclasts started out as a little game known as <em><a href="http://www.konjak.org/index.php?folder=9&amp;file=27" target="_blank">Ivory Springs</a></em> way back in 2007. By the middle of 2009, Konjak, the developer, <a href="http://www.konjak.org/index.php?entry=24" target="_blank">eventually decided to release<em> Ivory Springs</em> as abandonware</a> because he felt the gameplay was derivative and because he had started working full-time on a different game. While <em>Ivory Springs</em> could've been considered derivative for featuring gameplay similar to <em>Cave Story</em> and a setting that wouldn't feel out of place in a <em>Sonic</em> game, its fantastical landscapes and characters provided some lovely charm that alleviated any derivative qualities. Regardless of the game's potential, it seemed as if the developer moved on and that this was just another creative endeavor that was aborted when it was only half-formed.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9548" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="This is a picture of Ivory Springs. Compare it to pictures of The Iconoclasts and notice the radical change in the amount of detail."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IvorySprings_Rooftops.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9548" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IvorySprings_Rooftops.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.konjak.org/index.php?entry=48" target="_blank">Nearly two years later</a>, Konjak surprised his followers by releasing <strong>another</strong> abandonware version of <em>Ivory Springs</em>, though this time it was known by a new title despite the two versions sharing many characters, settings and themes. The new version was also remarkably better; the enemies were less annoying, the boss battles were more engaging, the art was stunningly beautiful and you could just feel so much more all-encompassing passion poured into this version of the game. If the loss of <em>Ivory Springs</em> was disappointing, then the loss of <em>The Iconoclasts</em> was heartbreaking.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9549" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="This picture summarizes most of the changes between versions. It's also a sample of the game's beautiful pixel art."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_CoolPlusOne.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9549 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_CoolPlusOne.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Fortunately, fans responded by offering verbal support and expressing interest in paying for a full version of the game. In the span of about a week, Konjak went from dejectedly thinking about throwing in the towel as a game developer to being cautiously optimistic about his future. Since it seems like an eventual full release of <em>The Iconoclasts</em> is planned, it only seemed appropriate to preview the game in order to highlight the quality available in the “demo.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Players focus on controlling Robin, a perky female mechanic with a penchant for helping out others with her talents. She doesn't talk much, though she's quite emotionally expressive via body language throughout the game. An interlude informs us that Robin's dad was also a mechanic and that he died some time ago, though there's no word on who or where her mother is.</p>
<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Backstory.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9550" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Backstory.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify">The main antagonist is an oppressive, and perhaps even totalitarian, organization known as the Concern, which forbids unauthorized tampering with machinery and Ivory (the common fuel source). As you can imagine, this makes Robin an outcast in the eyes of many in her society, and much of the story deals with her interactions with soldiers, agents and citizens loyal to the Concern. The game hasn't had much opportunity to flesh out this organization yet, but its members come across as similar to the Civil Protection in <em>Half-Life 2</em>, though low-ranking members are much more bumbling and nonthreatening.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9551" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Various members of the Concern."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Concern.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9551 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Concern.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">There are also these strange and hostile creatures inhabiting the bizarre environments that Robin explores. There doesn't seem to be any particular reason for most of them seeking to harm Robin, so I assume they are there mostly for the sake of having something to fight since Robin can't battle any human enemies (yet anyways). The creatures may also exist to serve as an antagonistic force that is actually overtly physically violent since the Concern currently comes across as more like thought police than brutal jackbooted thugs. Perhaps the developer feared we would get bored if we didn't have something to kill?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Speaking of combat, Robin currently has two weapons at her disposal: a stun gun and an oversized wrench. The stun gun is a standard blaster-type weapon, though a degree of auto-aim allows players to deftly avoid the annoyances inherent in directional restrictions on one's ability to fire their weapon. The wrench bashes enemies, cranks doors and gears for puzzles, and is even used to swing from things bolted to the environment. While <em>Ivory Springs</em> was like <em>Cave Story</em> with a couple of twists, the vibrant environments, alien enemies and wrench tool/weapon of <em>The Iconoclasts</em> make this version of the game much more like <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>. There's no robot buddy or excessive and wacky weaponry, but otherwise the feel of the aesthetics and gameplay are very similar. Furthermore, an equipment menu suggests that Robin may later acquire additional weapons and tools, which would make the <em>R&amp;C</em> comparison even more apt.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9552" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="By default, Robin can only fire her gun in the four cardinal directions. However, once she is within range of an enemy, she will automatically angle her gun to make it easier to hit them. It's a very refreshing change of pace and you'll probably grow to love this feature."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Boss1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9552 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Boss1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">One major difference from <em>R&amp;C</em> is that combat does not appear to be a primary focus of the game. Enemies serve more as minor obstacles along your path than things to be dominated and destroyed for personal gain. Staples of the Metroidvania genre like environmental puzzles, platforming segments, and exploration provide the actual challenge. Strangely, it is here where one change from the original<em> Ivory Springs</em> seems to make the game worse. In <em>Ivory Springs</em>, upgrades appeared in the form of simple collectibles like the Heart Containers from the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> series or the Missile Expansions of <em>Metroid</em>. In <em>The Iconoclasts</em>, one needs to collect metallurgic materials before taking them to special chemists to craft upgrades that alter RPG-esque character stats. I can't image why this change was made, as it only serves to break satisfying upgrades into pieces and be needlessly complicated. Is the old system of one item equals one upgrade really that bad?</p>


[caption id="attachment_9553" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="This is one of the four types of crafting materials that you can collect."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Electronium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9553 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Electronium.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Content-wise, the crafting system is my only gripe based off of my experiences thus far. I guess I could complain about an underdeveloped second world and the abrupt end that demarcates an inability to progress further, but I think such is to be expected since this was initially released as abandonware rather than a formal demo meant to be indicative of the final product. However, there are two unpleasant technical problems that should be addressed. The most important one is that the game suffers from slowdown at points. It's particularly noticeable in one very specific area of the first world as well as throughout many areas of the second world, which frequently seek to emulate image distortion caused by heat waves. I pretty much never have problems playing 2D games on my PC, so I'm assuming the slowdown is more the fault of the software than my hardware.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9554" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Note the distortion of the background."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_HeatWave.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9554 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_HeatWave.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The lesser, though still annoying, problem involves the controls for swinging segments. Initially, I seriously struggled with performing successive swings whenever they were necessary, and I feel like it's because the controls for this process lack calibration. Every time I would fail a swing, I was either too close to the point that I needed to swing from or a little off in my timing. The wrench has some range to it and doesn't seem to catch swing points immediately, so it caused me a lot of frustration until I stopped what I thought was an intuitive approach and forced myself to prep the wrench at a distance and prior to being at the same height as the swing point.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Mina.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9555" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Iconoclasts_Mina.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Don't let these complaints deter you from trying what's available now though, as it's still great despite its flaws. So many independently-developed platforming games just go for being small-scale and retro, but I believe <em>The Iconoclasts</em> has great potential to be a shining example of a <strong>modern</strong> 2D platformer in an era where such games appear infrequently or are sadly absent altogether.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An Ode to Turn Based Strategy</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/an-ode-to-turn-based-strategy-9653/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The turn based strategy is dead.  Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K games, the publishers of turn based strategy replacement substance <em>XCom</em>, <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111614-Xcom-Publisher-Strategy-Games-Are-Not-Contemporary">said so last month</a>, that turn based strategy was the old men sitting across from me in the coffee shop this morning talking about God.  The kids don't care about God, just like they don't care about Ray Charles or turn based strategy.  They want to shoot people and watch their heads explode in blood.  They want to be masters of their own destiny.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Turn-Based_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Turn-Based_1.jpg" alt="" title="Turn Based_1" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9691" /></a>

But when I sit on my couch and I play this year's remake of <em>Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</em>, or when I boot up <em>Solium Infernum </em>and give it another play, I'm reminded of how vibrant, how necessary turn based strategy can be.  And how, frankly, alive!  Yes, alive, it is.  Screw you, big publishers!  Your beloved first person shooters are dead!  Turn based strategy stands over it with its arm raised high, title belt in hand.

Okay, okay, the last part might have been going a little too far.  But in terms of sheer creativity, turn based strategy is a comet streaking across the sky, reminding us of just how brilliant games were and how weird and incredible they can be.

<em>Tactics Ogre </em>, the classic, remains my gold standard of Strategy RPGs.  It was one of the first to reach America, released (ported) on the Playstation over a decade ago, and it's still one of the finest.  The remake takes a punishing, old-school quest and modernizes it, creating a leveling system that is cool and clever and vital.  It takes the cruel, arbitrary difficulty of the original and repurposes it into a pinnacle of fairness.  You don't quit battles you're winning any more because the game got lucky and killed one of your troops forever, but rather because the enemy has fought you to a standstill.  The new leveling system, which levels up classes instead of individuals, is wacky and absurd but manages to create an experience that allows for significant customization.  In short, the game plays better than it ever has.

Couple this with a fantastic new translation, and we see what turn based strategy offers best: the grand sweep of war.  First Person Shooters, the genre every game must be to sell a million copies nowadays according to brain-dead publishers, might offer us an on the ground approach to war, but turn based strategy can place us in the shoes of the leader, the man who makes the decisions, and give us grand, strategic choices.  Few “modern” games outside of Deus Ex* really offer the player meaningful choices in terms of how to play the game (sorry, where to shoot a man doesn't really qualify as a choice, and neither does letting you refuse a reward to be "good"), but this is all turn based strategy is: do you move this man here, or have him kill that guy?  Do you play it safe, or do you press your advantage?  Do you optimize your attack team for this, or for that?  It is a grand collection of strategic options that make sure that no battles play out the same because of your decisions.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Turn-Based_3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Turn-Based_3.jpg" alt="" title="Turn Based_3" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9692" /></a>

The traditional PC turn based strategy, modeled off of board games, offers even more choices, more emergent narrative.  In <em>Solium Infernum</em>, <a href="http://www.crypticcomet.com/games/SI/Solium_Infernum.html" target="_blank">a game about princes of hell</a>, you begin as pieces on a board, but it can spawn so much more in the way of narrative vigor.  Another player screws you out of a specific territory for turn after turn, and suddenly he's the villain of the piece.  Another lord invades your kingdom through its soft underbelly, and he's a traitor.  You murder a fellow lord against the commands of the Assembly, and you've suddenly become an outcast, damned amongst the forces of Hell themselves.

And it's even better when all these players are your friends.  You'll remember that sweet headshot you pulled off on your girlfriend for a couple minutes, but that moment where you backstabbed your best friend in <em>Solium Infernum </em>at the height of his power will be legendary.  Think of it this way: your buddies are going to forget that game of Halo you won in about fifteen seconds, when the next one boots up.  You remember that game of <em>Monopoly </em>where your mother turned over the board, disowned your sister, and burnt the kitchen down with a teapot forever.  Turn based strategy is like <em>Monopoly</em>, but without the soul crushing awfulness.

The thing, though, that draws me most to turn based strategy is innovation.  In terms of innovation it's the genre running fastest and freest, with new ideas appearing almost as fast as they can be consumed.  For years, the genre has offered, effectively, experiences that could be described as very in depth board games.  <em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em>, for instance, is just a massive, infinitely complex board game, where you move pieces around a board against a similarly empowered AI opponent.  Games like <em>Civilization </em>and <em>Heroes of Might and Magic </em>were colorful games played out on distinct, ever-changing boards without the need for friends.  <em>Civilization</em>, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77130/sid-meiers-civilization-the-board-game" target="_blank">in fact, became a board game</a>!  They were good experiences, but they were not particularly novel except that you could play them all the time.  Their voice was the voice of traditional board games.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/turn-based_2.gif"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/turn-based_2.gif" alt="" title="turn based_2" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9693" /></a>

Now, turn based strategy is finding its voice, despite the near total lack of support from major publishers.  Credit the <em>Total War</em> series (Sega, in general, actually--good on them) for setting off the first sparks in this explosion of creativity.  The game sees turn based strategy, and then raises it a real time component, something that only a video game could do.  Instead of just being about administrating and running an empire, something that could be done on a board, they added the ability to resolve your battles without relying on numbers.

<em>King's Bounty:  The Legend </em>helped too. It took the PC turn based masterpiece of <em>Heroes of Might and Magic </em>and out-did it by placing the player in a large, persistent world.  It took turn based strategy and added considerable RPG elements to it, creating a mixture that's better than peanut butter and chocolate.  It's expansive and addictive.

And on the console front, we had <em>Valkyria Chronicles</em>.  <em>Valkyria Chronicles </em>took turn based war gaming and threw it on its head, allowing the player to play out everyone's turn in a first person shooter by way of JRPG fashion.  Even though the enemies can't move on your turn, you're given the ability to launch a grand strategy with elements of the boots on the earth part of war.  It added to the recurring theme: that this was a genre where there was plenty of room for experimentation, and plenty of room for improvement.  It could become a vital, important genre again by adding additional elements.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/turn-based_4.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/turn-based_4.jpg" alt="" title="turn based_4" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9694" /></a>

Now we're seeing more turn based strategy games than we've ever seen before, and they're all adding fascinating new twists to the genre.  On one hand, there's <em><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/5649-5649/" target="_blank">Frozen Synapse</a></em>, a game we've talk about significantly in the past that adds significant new planning elements to the genre.  Turns are simultaneous and intense, the result of significant planning, an idea probably cribbed from board games like Diplomacy but which plays out in a way decidedly interactive.  We've seen the expansion of the PC strategy market to contain more games than there are board games about the <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34635/stone-age" target="_blank">Stone Age</a>, featuring play by email wonders like the aforementioned <em>Solium Infernum</em>, <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/" target="_blank">freeware hotseat wonder <em>Battle of Wesnoth</a></em>, and online cooperative multiplayer title <em><a href="http://blight.ironhelmet.com/" target="_blank">Blight of the Immortals </a></em>(which you'll see more coverage of in the future, I assure you).  These are games attempting to keep the crucial social elements of board games while retaining the high strategy.  On the other hand, we have vibrant innovations like <em><a href="http://www.braincandy.fr/" target="_blank">Fray</a></em>, which is attempting to add RPG elements to the wonder that is <em>Frozen Synapse</em>, and <em><a href="http://www.xenonauts.com/" target="_blank">Xenonauts</a></em>, which is attempting to provide the <em>X-Com </em>experience that <em>XCom </em>refuses to provide.  Even <em>Ghost Recon: Shadow Warrior</em>, a big name title from the 3DS launch, is supposedly the best of the limited 3DS lineup.  Imagine that: a new system whose killer app is a turn based strategy game*.

That's really the most disappointing aspect of the <em>XCom </em>remake.  Rather than try to take a “dead” genre and innovate it back into the public eye, something no doubt difficult but possible, something that would have netted them significant critical acclaim, they've taken the path of least resistance, making a first person shooter in an era where they saturate the market.  They've said the genre isn't vibrant, but there's none other as tumultuous with innovation.  There's no genre so primed for a major publisher breakthrough than turn based strategy.  Perhaps they could have made a game where you make strategic choices on a big map and then experience the on the ground segments as a tactical squad based first person shooter?  <em>Fallout 3</em> figured out a way to build on a classic franchise without completely violating the spirit and intent of the original game, so it doesn't seem too much to ask for XCom to attempt the same instead of just cashing in on the old name with a first person shooter.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/turn-based_5.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/turn-based_5.jpg" alt="" title="turn based_5" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9695" /></a>

I have to, in the end, refute 2K Marin's assertion that the turn based strategy is dead.  There's an imagination, a vibrancy, a emergent nature to the genre that makes it represent the best of video games.  While the zeitgeist of the first person shooter is the intense, immediate thrill, turn based strategy offers the slow burn of strategy and wit, an unrelenting build up until eventually the walls come crashing down around your enemies as they are powerless to stop it.

----

*The original, which is still an eminently modern game despite its terrible graphics.  I'd say it is ultra-modern, a game that feels like it was released in the future.

*Shoo, zombie PSP!  We know Strategy RPGs are the only thing you offer!  Shoo!  I know I  have a half dozen games for you and five of them are SRPGs.  I know!  Shoo, I say!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Turn-based over RTS, every time.

With the exception of a precious few, RTS' nearly always turn into C&amp;C-style arms races centred around who can get the most tanks together in the shortest space of time. Coupled with the fact that RTS rarely gives you the proper room to really try out any in depth tactics. 

Compare that with X-Com or Age Of Wonders where battles and hopeless causes can rest on a knife-edge. One lucky grenade, one puny unit punching above its weight for a single precious turn giving you victory.

Innovation is a very good word to use. Some of the more successful battle systems in the recent Final Fantasy games have been moving towards turn-based combat, not the much-vaunted 'active time battle' they used to trumpet. Probably for the simple reason that they realised it gave the player more opportunities to try different things as well as give them a greater and more varied challenge.

On a side-note, as much as I loved the first two X-Coms, the one that always did it for me was Apocalypse. Although special mention has to go to the UFO franchise, which also stayed true to what made the games so great.

In short, I'll be trying out most of the games you guys mentioned. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

Nightmare Mode has three codes for <em>SPAZ</em>, the fantastic top down space combat game that made our own Chris Sommer <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/space-pirates-and-zombies-impressions-part-ii-5060/" target="_blank">turn into a horrible human being</a>. So, what do you have to do to have a shot at winning one of the Steam keys? There are two ways for you to enter. The first way is via the site itself--just leave a comment on this post answering the following question:
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Just how far are you willing to go to survive an encounter with Space Zombies?"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second way to enter is via our <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nitemaremodenet" target="_blank">Twitter account</a>. There, we will be launching a tweet asking "Which is cooler? Space pirates or space zombies?"; answer and retweet for a chance to win there. And, of course, you must be following our account in order to be eligible to win the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You are welcome to participate in both, as it increases your chance to win one of the keys. We will be picking winners from both on Saturday, August 20th at 5 PM Eastern. Good luck!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you'd like to know more about the game, make sure to read our extensive preview, <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/05/space-pirates-and-zombies-impressions-4688/" target="_blank">here. </a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>No Server Browser for Battlefield 3 on PC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[But it will still have dedicated servers, you just can't browse them in-game.

Confused? Well, let me explain things. In order to switch servers in <i>Battlefield 3</i> on the PC, you'll have to exit the game, go onto the Battlelog site (Battlelog is essentially a Battlefield 3 hub. It's not actually up yet), pick a server from there, then the game will start up and you'll join.

Now, that may sound like a stupidly obtuse way to do something that every single PC game with dedicated serves can do faster without having to exit the game, but in Battlefield 3's defense, it boots up <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Demize99/status/104146179016753152">real fast</a>.

Not sure why they couldn't just, I don't know, integrate Battlefield 3's primary social hub into the game itself, but whatever.

This comes after the news that consoles will get a <a href="http://bf3blog.com/2011/08/battlefield-3-server-browser-confirmed-for-consoles/" />server browser</a>.

I'd make a snappy remark or something, but honestly... it feels like it just wouldn't be enough.

		<title>Mojang vs. Bethesda Quake Match Will Probably Never Happen</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bad news everyone, Minecraft creator "Notch" and Bethesda won't be going head-to-head on the bloodied field of glory in Quake III. The dispute between Bethesda and Mojang regarding Mojang's newest game still in development, <em>Scrolls</em>, will likely be settled in a regular, dull courthouse, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/minecraft-bethesda-lawsuit/">Wired reports</a>. Notch has not heard from Bethesda since <a href="http://notch.tumblr.com/post/9038258448/hey-bethesda-lets-settle-this">announcing his challenge</a> three days ago.

The dispute started after Bethesda quite suddenly decided to sue Mojang for copyright infringement, claiming that the title "<em>Scrolls</em>" conflicted with their trademark "<em>The Elder Scrolls</em>" game series. Notch stated that he believed a Quake III tournament would be "good PR" for both companies, and that Mojang's lawyers are on the case, although he himself finds the process "terribly boring", hinting that his time and energy are being devoted to other matters. Nonetheless, he is prepared to "...fight this for as long as it takes," exhibiting some puzzlement with Bethesda's decision, refering to the fact that plenty of their games have shared nouns with other titles in the past.

According to Wired, though, Bethesda's lawsuit is not unwarranted, as they spoke with industry expert Mark Methenitis. Methenitis stated that the similarities in titles might not mean much to the informed gamer (such as you, dear reader of Nightmare Mode) who knows the major differences between the two games, but to the casual consumer the two titles are more easily blended together.

Honestly, though, was anyone really expecting Bethesda to accept the challenge? No. But not all hope is lost. Maybe, just maybe, someone valiant at Bethesda will stand up and demand that the challenge be met. And in the ensuing fragfest the one true, honorable bearer of the trademark "<em>Scrolls</em>" will prevail.

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Over a period of weeks, I interviewed Michael Samyn, one half of the Belgian-based development team <a href="http://tale-of-tales.com/" target="_blank">Tale of Tales</a>, which is particularly known for <em>The Path</em>, <em>The Graveyard</em> and <em>The Endless Forest</em>. What follows is a series of eighteen questions that span ToT's past, present and future in creating interactive art.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. What initially motivated you to pursue developing interactive art?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. We had dabbled a bit with the interactive potential of computers back when we were using the machine primarily as a tool for other arts. But it was only when the graphical web browser was born, that we resolutely chose to make digital interactive art only. Our initial motivation was a desire to reach an audience directly, without mediation by galleries or publishers. But we soon developed a taste for interactivity as a welcome ingredient in our work. In fact, in a way, it turned out that procedural, non-linear, interactive pieces were the thing that we had been trying to create all along in the wrong media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. What enabled you, in regards to both money and motivation, to develop as you please instead of working under a large publisher like many other developers?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. I object to the use of "as you please" when it comes to art. It makes it sound like we're doing something frivolous and that we're doing this for selfish reasons. That's not how it feels to me. For me artistic creation is almost like a divine duty. We owe it to humanity to do this work, to create this art. It's our contribution to culture and civilisation. This is especially important in a time when civilisation seems to be considered optional. We work against what seems like a world wide regress to an animal state of being. At the very least, we want to keep the flame of civilisation alive, if only for later, smarter generations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started our careers as digital artists by supporting our purely artistic creations through design work we did for clients. But we didn't consider the separation between the two to be very important. We tried to make our designs artistically valuable and we tried to make our art accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back then we were creating web-based art and the projects were relatively small and quick to produce. When we started using game technology, however, we realized that we were going to have to work full time on our art. We simply couldn't afford to do client work any more: we didn't have the time! This medium is very demanding, both in terms of research and development. So we started looking for arts funding to support our work. In the mean time, we have been able to create a second stream of financial support from the sales of our games. And that way we're happily back where we started: in a direct relationship with our audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason why we don't work with a publisher is also out of necessity. The kind of exploratory work that we do, and the process through which we do it, is not something that publishers are likely to support. They basically don't trust us with their money. Which is ironic since Tale of Tales is still around (almost a decade now), while many of the so-called more reliable developers (and publishers) have gone out of business. But it's hard to fight a prejudice. If publishers do not want to support our work, then we have no choice but to do it ourselves. Because the work needs to be done. It's important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. How much (or how little) do you personalize your works? Do you feel that you tend towards universal themes, personal themes or a mix of both? Why did you make this stylistic choice?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. The degree depends on the piece. We're also two people. So, per definition, we never make ultra-personal work, since the work will always at least carry a bit of Auriea and a bit of me. And then there's also the input of our collaborators, whom we consider to be fellow artists contributing their own sensitivities to the work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wouldn't say we choose universal themes to work with. That's a bit too broad. But we do like working with thematic material that a relatively large group of people can relate too or is even familiar with. This is one of the reasons why we like to use old texts as a starting point (fairy tales, stories from the bible, myths). We obviously choose the specific pieces because of a personal attraction to them, but it is often only during the actual creation that we start putting things of ourselves in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a way, creating our games is a little bit like playing them: an exploration of certain themes, poking around in one's own spirit to see how it responds to certain ideas and sentiments. This way, we often discover the reason why we chose to work with a certain theme very late in the process. It could of course be that we're twisting the theme to fit our personal concerns. It's probably a bit of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have recently created a prototype that dealt with more universal themes and [emotions]. But we're not completely satisfied with it. One of the reasons for this is probably that we feel more comfortable dealing with concrete stories and characters and situations. We prefer to start with a story and then open it up so that the player can perhaps find some universal or personal value. In the end our work should be about the player, not about its creator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Personally, I've never been able to justify making a piece of art with the intent to sell it. Whenever someone does so, I feel like they are being somewhat of a "mercenary" artist, with advertising and propaganda being particularly extreme examples of "art for hire". I appreciate and understand the sentiment of artists wanting to earn a living off of their work, but I feel that paid artists often have to compromise their craft in order to be a "safe" or "reliable" investment. I think the street performer method of generating money is a bit less troublesome as it allows people to decide if they liked your art enough to pay for it after having experienced it. With many other methods of paying for art, it seems like the art in question is being held for ransom. Do you feel any cognitive dissonance by charging for any of your works? Why or why not?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. The outcome of the combination of money and art really depends on the individual artist. Some artists create their best work when they are commissioned, while others need to be completely isolated from any financial concerns. Some artists function better in poverty and despair, others need to be surrounded by luxury and comfort. Some art improves if artists consider their audience, other art is completely ruined by such "selling out". It really depends on the situation, the type of work and the personality of the artist. There is no golden rule. Even the artist himself might not realize which situation is best for him. Heck, the artist might not even realize which of his pieces is the better work of art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On top of that, complete freedom for the artists seems to lead to isolation of the arts. We have seen this happen in the 20th century, when fine arts divorced themselves from craft and industry in favour of a modern notion of freedom of expression. The result has been disastrous! At the moment fine arts have become a niche of continuous self-references that has lost all connection with society. I believe it is no coincidence that we are seeing a rise of fundamentalism and populism in such circumstances. I believe art can counter such barbarous tendencies but today the artists are far away, twiddling their thumbs in the museum in vain arrogance. For this reason, it is important that artists create work that is not only accessible to the audience on an intellectual and emotional level, but that is also presented in places where the audience can witness it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We live in a technology-driven consumerist society. As a result, the arts that have most influenced culture in the last half century have not been the expensive pièces uniques that media like painting and sculpture produce, but the widely distributed and cheaply accessible art forms of literature, cinema and pop music. And now video games are adding another medium to this group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Artists have a responsibility in society. They have to show people what they see. They have to stimulate people's imagination, they have to help them question things, wonder about things, find joy in life. The first essential step to accomplish this is that the art is seen by people. This is why it is wise for an artist to choose a medium (and even a form) that is accessible to the audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the realm of video games, there's another peculiarity. While I find it perfectly acceptable for an artist to make a living off of his work that allows him to devote his entire existence to its creation, one might be inclined to distribute one's work for free on the internet. Oddly, however, free games are per definition not as well respected as games that people pay for. This is probably because video games have always been produced in a commercial and highly technological industry and free games are mostly made cheaply made and thus fail to impress the regular gamer. But if the game carries a price tag, suddenly the attention perks up and everybody has an opinion about it. So even if the artist doesn't need to sell his video game for financial reasons (if he's independently wealthy for instance, or receives sufficient arts funding, or has a girlfriend to look after him), it still remains a good idea to charge for the work. It will help spread the work further. And that is an important goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have the opportunity now, with the internet, to completely change the economy. It is actually possible now to get rid of the capitalist/consumerist business model. Simply because a producer can now access his audience directly. Theoretically it should be possible to create small self-sustaining communities of artists and audience that need no interference. This is another reason why I find it ok for an artist to charge for their work. It creates a form of independence that is far removed from both the need for subsidies and the need to please the market or the requirement to make simple, cheap work and/or live in poverty/have a day job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FATALE2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9724" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FATALE2.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="1024" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Do you think there is an overreliance on entertainment to engage players? If so, what other forms of engagement would be well-suited for an interactive medium?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. Coming from a fine arts background, I find this rather difficult to comment on. The fact that video games are entertaining and engaging is an important reason why I choose to work in this medium as an artist. I find most contemporary fine art dull and not engaging. And I don't see why this should be. In fact, I think it's important that an artist tries to seduce his audience and gives people some sensual pleasure, starting with beauty (which is horribly absent in the contemporary art scene).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, commercial games will err in the other extreme. If profit is one of the main goals in the creation of a game, entertainment will serve the purpose of hooking the player and making them pay (more). The problem is not the entertainment as such, but the reason for it. If profit is the main motivation for production, then the game will probably be hollow and devoid of meaning, warmth, sincerity, etc. This kind of entertainment if of course mental robbery. It takes away important time from the short life of a human and gives nothing in return. Doing this to fill one's own pockets is a moral crime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's another aspect to this discussion, though. For many designers, the element of "fun" is very much related to the craft of making games. A good game is a fun game in their eyes (whether or not it is profitable). This is probably true if you consider games to be abstract systems of rules designed to challenge players to achieve a certain goal. But to me, video games are something else. A sports-like system like this is only one of many ways in which a video game can be structured. Video games can also be beautiful, meaningful, moving, etc. All of those things that art in other media can be. Fun should only be a means to an end. If fun supports your goal of giving the player a beautiful, meaningful experience, by all means use it. But if you're sincere about these goals, you'll find that superficial fun is often distracting and moves the player further away from achieving a deeply meaningful aesthetic experience, from being moved, from experiencing wonder, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engagement should come from the content of the game, the narrative and poetic elements, the theme, the atmosphere. Any interaction should be designed with the purpose of expressing these to the player. This is no different than artistic creation in any other medium.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Is there anything about modern game development that particularly disappoints you? That inspires you or makes you hopeful?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. The thing that most disappoints me, and many players of video games, is the lack of evolution in interaction design. This is a very common complaint. It has been voiced widely throughout the gaming community for as long as I have been involved with it (which is close to a decade). Video games have come a long way in terms of presentation, but in terms of gameplay nothing seems to have changed. Underneath the beautiful landscapes and convincing characters of contemporary video games, we're still playing <em>Pong</em>, <em>Pac Man</em> or <em>Commander Keen</em>. Game designers have continuously refined these conventional design patterns, but very few have tried to escape them. Which is odd because the computer offers so much potential to move far beyond those rudimentary systems. And every gamer knows this. And every non-gamer expects it. And all the marketing people are selling games based on the promise of adventure, exploration, travel, fantasy, only to lock you into a rigid Skinner-type system of endless cycles of challenges and rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing that makes me hopeful and fills me with confidence is exactly the raw capacity for beauty and immersion [that] contemporary video games display. And also the clear desire in their designs to be more than just playthings. Video games now want to tell stories, want to take us away, immerse us in their worlds, etc. Sometimes, when the demands of the formal game play are relaxed, they get very close to fulfilling this dream. It feels like any minute now, video games are going to "break through the game barrier". And then they will become the rich medium that we have all been seeing in it for years, the medium that will be to the 21st century what film was to the 20th.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. In a previous response, you mentioned that you felt that modern art is disconnected from modern society. Do you think that more games should explore social commentary and satire? (Previous occurrences of such have been largely confined, at least in the sense of popular games that reach mass audiences, to entries in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> franchise.) Do you think the industry is averse to this because it could decrease the potential user base and profitability of a game? Or do you think it is due to some other reason?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. I'm afraid that I don't consider "social commentary and satire" very high goals for art. I find art more valuable if it is about personal experience, if it connects to something deep inside of me, gives me a sense for what humans share with each other, and our place in the cosmos. I don't think it is the content so much as the form that has [led] to a separation of fine art and society. This problem, by the way, has been addressed by other art forms such as cinema, theater, literature and music, which have succeeded in maintaining a close link to the audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Video-games have been less successful in this respect. They are still very much a niche culture. Only gamers like games. They have expanded somewhat on one end (of games as pure entertainment) through casual games, the Wii and social games. But on the other end (as an artistic medium, like films, books and music) video-games have so far been virtually non-existent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I must admit that I don't really understand why this is the case. The artistic potential of video-games is clear to everyone (for proof simply read the promises made by games marketing). We all want this medium in which we can interact with a story. The demand is clearly there. But so far, the games industry has refused to grow in that direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only reason I can think of is that it's very difficult to figure out how exactly we should do this: how can we turn video-games into a medium? In the commercial AAA market this is most commonly attempted by making the gameplay very easy and adding elements from other media (text, movies, music, etc). Only few AAA developers have explored the potential of the technology itself to provide for a media experience (<em>Heavy Rain</em> is the main and perhaps only example, maybe <em>Ico</em> a little bit). Even in indie circles there's very little attention to this. Often indies are even more hardcore and niche-oriented than their AAA colleagues. And because of their limited means, they often don't have much room to experiment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because that is what is needed: in order to figure out how to optimally use this technology and allow a new medium to grow out of it, we need to experiment. I don't understand why the big publishers and developers don't invest in this experimentation when the commercial benefits are so immensely obvious, not to mention the impact a video-games-medium might have on culture at large and the increased respectability of our profession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course it's difficult, but since when has that been a reason to shy away from things in this industry? Maybe this problem is intimidating because it is one that cannot be solved through technology alone. We cannot crack this by simply throwing more programmers at it. This is an artistic problem, and as such it needs to be solved by artists. It's simple: hire artists and give them tools.</p>
<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TheGraveyard.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9725 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TheGraveyard.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="389" /></a><strong></strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Switching gears a bit, let's start talking about some of your projects. The key difference between the free and purchasable versions of <em>The Graveyard</em> is that the player character may die. Why did you feel that the possibility of death was an important aspect of the game?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. The possibility of death is inherent in the situation, isn't it? You are playing an old woman. One of the typical aspects of old age is that death is near. We just felt we needed to go there. We needed to take the experience to its logical outcome. And we added this element to a special version of the game that you can only play when you pay for it, to accentuate how special it is: how death makes a difference. It was also a commentary on how we experience games and feel that other people could experience them. It's not about numbers of levels and kinds of weapons and length of gameplay. What matters is the intensity of the experience. And having the main character die on you is a drastically different emotional experience, even if technically the difference is very small and even if the play time might in fact be shorter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to this inherent motivation, we had a desire to address the way death was usually treated in video-games, namely simply as the expression of a fail state. It is well known that game design has not changed drastically since the stone age, let alone since <em>Pac Man</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em>. But computer technology has changed enormously. And to see these believable characters die these nonsensical deaths is really painful to us. We feel that if you're going to show death, it should really be death, death as we, humans, know it well: a sad lonely death of old age, nothing spectacular about it, no murder, no accident, just naturally slipping away. This is why <em>The Graveyard</em> ends when the woman dies. You can't even close the application anymore. Death is the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Why did your project named <em>8</em> (and later <em>The Book of 8</em>) end up in development hell?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. It didn't. We are currently prototyping a new version of <em>8</em>, originally codenamed <em>The Book of 8</em>. It's going well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>8</em> was our first video-game project. We worked on it from 2002 to 2005. Back then, independent development of a moderately ambitious title wasn't really an option, mostly because broadband internet didn't exist yet and there were no digital distribution platforms like there are now. So we were forced to organize the production according to the then standard model: find a publisher willing to loan the production budget up front. One of the many downsides of this model, as we experienced with <em>8</em>, is that the decision whether a game is actually made or not is down to the publishers. And publishers are not often willing to take a risk or support something because they believe in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We made several prototypes of <em>8</em>, put together a production team and presented our idea to many publishers. We got pretty far in the negotiations with some of them, but in the end, <em>8</em> proved to be too unconventional to find real support. So we were forced to abandon the project, and review our entire approach to game development. Which, in the end, turned out to be a good thing. But that doesn't mean that we're not still traumatized by this initial experience with the games industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. What lessons were learned from developing your multiplayer game known as <em>The Endless Forest</em>? Do you think you will eventually delve into multiplayer again? Or will you just stick with single player games?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. One of the consequences of failing to find commercial backing for <em>8</em> was our desire to publish a game ourselves. We had already developed the concept and a small prototype of<em> The Endless Forest</em> in response to an art commission from the museum of modern art in Luxembourg. After realizing that we were not going to find funding for the full production, we decided to cut up development of the project [into] several small phases, production of which could be funded through art grants. In order to ensure production and publication, we reduced the scope of the first phase of the game to its bare essentials: a single avatar model in a small environment with a minimal amount of actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing we learned from<em> The Endless Forest</em> was that we were actually able to publish a game, by ourselves. I guess we sort of re-invented independent publishing by ourselves, out of necessity, without knowing much about the games industry's history. We find it extremely important to show our work to an audience. It's one of the main reasons why started using this medium. We were very happy and proud to have pulled this of. And it set a [precedent] for us: we had figured out a way in which we could create our work, without requiring publisher support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second thing we learned from <em>The Endless Forest</em> and that has influenced our work to this day, is that people don't need a lot of pre-designed structure to amuse themselves. By necessity, the first phase of <em>The Endless Forest</em> was very minimal in terms of interactivity. And thanks to it being multiplayer, we could actually observe what people were doing in the game. It came as a real revelation to us, to see how creative players were with the limited amount of gameplay. They invented whole new games before our very eyes and made up stories about the game world, etc. This ultimately lead to our abandoning the original design of the game in favour of simply collaborating with the players on what to implement next.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Endless Forest</em> is incredibly successful to this very day. So much so that we can't really advertise it out of fear that our feeble technology wouldn't be able to cope with any more players. There's a thriving community around the game that not only plays the game but produces all sorts of fan art and fan fiction too. [As a developer, it's really nice to know] that your players are right there, having fun with your work. Whenever we feel a bit down, we just dip into the Forest and have a little run around with our deer. It's very relaxing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Multiplayer games require constant care, and<em> The Endless Forest</em> being a free game – thanks to the continuing support of the Mudam museum in Luxembourg – doesn't make this easier. So I don't think we'll be starting up another MMO any time soon. It's a very demanding thing for a small studio. That being said, we do have plans for a two-player online game. We will be working on that next year.</p>
<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FATALE.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9726 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/FATALE.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="1024" /></a><strong></strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. You recommended that people play <em>FATALE</em> especially if they didn't like video games. Why did you make such a recommendation for this notgame of yours and not others?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. I think we do recommend this for all our games. It's more or less a mission statement for us to try and make video-games for people who do not play them yet. <em>Fatale</em> is perhaps a little bit more special because it contains even fewer conventions than the others, making it more accessible to people not familiar with these conventions. Its subject matter probably also appeals to people outside of the [gaming] community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But <em>Fatale</em> was still made before the epiphany we had when we started the notgames initiative. We had always been critical of many game conventions and always felt that they stood in the way of wider enjoyment of the medium, but it wasn't until early 2010 that we really took up the explicit challenge of simply rejecting as much influence from conventional game design as we could. Before that, we always had the inclination to include game-like elements. Sometimes because we simply weren't critical and we just gave in to what felt natural (after having played so many conventional games). Sometimes because we were worried that people would be bored if we didn't give them something to do. Sometimes because we felt we needed [the traditional gaming audience] to buy our game because otherwise we would go broke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think this wishy-washy attitude may have weakened our designs and reduced their emotional impact. But perhaps it was a necessary transition phase both for us and the audience. I have a feeling that a lot more is possible at the moment [now] and that we're all ready for something new. So the projects we are currently working on will probably be even more appealing to people who don't play video-games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Unlike portable handhelds, other portable devices like phones, tablets and music players are sometimes not considered 'real' games platforms. Based off of your experiences with developing and distributing <em>Vanitas</em> for the iPod and iPhone, do you think such portable devices and their application distribution services provide a better or worse environment for games outside the paradigm of entertainment-centric experiences? And does the different control scheme hinder or foster creativity and possibility in regards to how players interact with the game?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. I'm not a fan of handheld devices for our work. I want to create worlds. And the windows to these worlds offered by handheld devices are simply too small. Plus by being handheld these devices continuously remind the user that they exist, which makes it difficult to become immersed in the fiction of a game. And finally phones in particular seem to favour extremely casual types of play because people tend to play to kill time when waiting for the bus or something, instead of dedicating time to it like they would to a film or a console game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But you are right that the diverse audience that uses these devices is attractive to us. We wanted to test if there was an audience for our work by releasing <em>Vanitas</em> on iPhone. And there is, but it is very small. Partially, probably, because of the awkward environment of Apple's app store which seems to focus on promoting things that are already successful. And, apart [from] <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/" target="_blank">CreativeApplications.net</a>, I don't know of any site that carefully selects apps for a specific audience. Most are very general. Maybe because it's such a mainstream medium?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of the nature of these devices, the things we want to make for them are more object than world. And the specific input medium is suitable for some projects and not for others. It doesn't offer greater freedom but it does [offer] opportunity for different types of interactions. This is nice, but not our main focus as designers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest problem with these portable devices is that they are very weak computers. Regular desktop computers and consoles are already far too slow for what we really would like to make, let alone these underpowered handhelds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. What do you think made <em>The Path</em> one of your most successful projects? During its development and after its release, was there anything that surprised you about the reactions of media outlets, conventions or players? Anything that disappointed you?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. Well, it's kind of pathetic, but what made <em>The Path</em> our most successful product was wanting it to be so. We wanted it to be successful because we took out a huge loan to produce it and not paying back this loan would mean the end of Tale of Tales and probably years of misery too. I call it pathetic because I'm not used to being rewarded for my efforts. We designed<em> The Path</em> on purpose to appeal to a wide variety of people. We playtested the game and adjusted the design to the results of these tests. We gave it our best shot because we felt we should try this at least once. But deep down we didn't really believe that this effort was going to pay off. But it did: <em>The Path</em> became our most successful game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't get me wrong: I'm not sad about this. It's actually comforting to know that we can do this stuff on purpose. And it's funny to see how many people still consider <em>The Path</em> as somewhat of an extreme/insane/mega-artistic game while for us it was the most accessible one, the one that was designed to please the public. Maybe we have found an ideal middle ground here: a compromise between artistic ambition and connecting to an audience. The only downside is that this type of design costs money. It's generally much cheaper to just follow your gut feeling and create what you desire. But when you start taking the audience into account, and include thorough playtesting in your process, then your production budget easily doubles or [triples]. At least that's how it works for us, because we apparently have aberrant tastes and so we can't trust our own instincts in design decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, we were very surprised by the generally positive response in the video-games press. As well as by the overwhelming silence everywhere else. We were hoping to appeal to non-gamers with <em>The Path</em> as we expected only a luke-warm reception in the gaming community. We thought our work would just be considered too weird or boring by gamers. But we had underestimated probably the size but definitely the desire to play something different in the gaming community. The thing that we – shamefully – sometimes forget is that gamers are people too. And as people they have interests in many different things. Even many people who play the most hardcore of shooter games online every night have a place in their hearts where a strange game like<em> The Path</em> can fit. Nobody does something 100% of the time. People like variety. And I guess we offered some with <em>The Path</em>. At the same time, we found it near impossible to have the non-gaming press talk about <em>The Path</em>, or finding another way to reach the non-gaming audience. As an independent studio without the budget of Nintendo or Zynga, the non-gaming audience is more or less beyond our reach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This lead to a bit of confusion within Tale of Tales: we wanted to make games for non-gamers but we found relative success within the gaming community. For a moment we figured that this meant we should work harder to make our video-games more game-like, to put in more things that this new-found audience would be used to. But I think this was a mistake. I think the reason why gamers might be interested in our work is precisely because it is different, because it is unlike what they are used to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. Backing up to </strong><em><strong>The Endless Forest</strong></em> <strong>for a brief moment, another staff member wanted to know two things: Where did the idea for the game come from? And why do the characters have human faces attached to animal bodies à la </strong><em><strong>Seaman</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. The idea came to us already in the train ride home from Luxembourg where we had been commissioned by the museum after giving a presentation about the web-based art we were doing before making games. This ride goes straight through the Ardennes, an area of Belgium with wooded mountains. So we were simply inspired by the view out of the train window. But there was also an underlying thought. We had been doing a weekly web-based performance called <a href="http://entropy8zuper.org/wirefire/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #003ea8;">Wirefire</span></a>. We really loved being able to join up with people and perform our live art (a bit like online audiovisual dj-ing). But we were frustrated by the fact that this art work was dead without our presence. People could only enjoy it, really, when we were there. So <em>The Endless Forest</em> was a way for us to have a piece in which people could gather but that could also function without our presence. We simply enhance the experience when we are there, during the so-called Abiogenesis festivals we organise in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The deer character was designed by our friend <a href="http://cocooncharacters.com/main.php">Lina Kusaite</a>. Originally we had envisioned the game to feature natural looking deer. In fact, our very first prototypes have real deer in them. So when Lina presented her first sketches, we tried to discourage her and told her we wanted regular deer in our game. But she persisted and we decided to give it a try, to see how the players would respond. We ended up being quite happy with the design, because it adds an immediate feeling of wonder and mystery and it contributes to the kinds of narratives that you can make up about the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. You've mentioned some benefits of digital distribution and self-publishing a few times now, so I wanted to ask you about something that's seemingly endemic to these options. While independent publishing and other things like Valve's Steam, Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade, </strong>
<strong>Sony's PlayStation Store and so on are less restrictive on risky or innovative ventures, most of the games available are "small". In this day and age, it seems like if you want to commercially release a game, you're often either developing a multimillion behemoth with the backing of a ton of staff and a big publisher or you're developing a niche game that's smaller in scope and has a budget of anywhere from shoestring to a couple hundred thousand with the hope that you can eventually recoup your expenses through some form of digital distribution. There just doesn't seem to be much middle ground, such as a big publisher funding a project that isn't just a homogenous cash cow but costs one million dollars to flesh out its potential. Do you think a solution is on the horizon or perhaps already exists? Or do you think this divide is due to a fundamental difference in motive, such as the overriding desire for a stable investment versus a zealous drive for pushing the boundaries of the medium regardless of the financial incentive?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. I disagree with the contrast you're suggesting between big "AAA" productions and independent games in terms of commercial viability. Many AAA projects end up in commercial disasters, many AAA developers go bankrupt shortly after finishing their game, the competition is fierce and financial risk considerable, given the huge budgets involved. Making smaller games for a smaller audience is often much more commercially viable. I think there [are] as many dreamers making AAA games as indie games. And also as many commercially-motivated people in either camp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think you'll see more and more publishers realizing this and investing in the production of small games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, this still leaves the problem of the moderately sized game: small enough to be artistically ambitious and big enough to optimize the impact of this ambition. This is indeed extremely rare. Thatgamecompany's <em>Journey</em> falls in this category. And probably the first <em>Portal</em> too. Maybe Eric Chahi's <em>From Dust</em> as well? Maybe publishers will realize that there is commercial opportunity in these products too, especially if digital distribution becomes dominant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another way in which medium sized independent games development might happen is how it works in film. Very few films, even independent films, are made with budgets as small as those of indie games. Making films costs money. Everyone knows that. So next to the huge Hollywood blockbusters, there's also a very large offering of independent films, each made with a budget that would feel very comfortable to most any indie games developer, indeed. Independent film makers have access to this kind of money (through private funds and government subsidies) because their work is respected as an important cultural form, and because civilized societies believe that the making of this art is important for mankind. If and when video-games reach the same cultural status as film, we will have access to these sources of funding as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. The main Tale of Tales blog is noted as having closed down due to discomfort with the format. Since you still maintain separate blog-like pages for some of your projects, why did you choose to close down the main blog and not others? Besides serving as interesting stuff to read, developer diaries and logs can often help players to be more invested in both the corresponding project and its developer, so it seems like you are disadvantaging yourself by removing this link between artist and audience.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. There were many reasons why we closed our blog. First of all because it had served its purpose, which was indeed to prepare the world for <em>The Path</em>. And because, at the time when we closed the blog, we were getting ready to "go underground". We were starting two prototyping projects and we felt that there was no need for us to advertise anything while we were doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also seemed that the blog format had run its course. We wanted to figure out a new way to keep in touch with our audience, temporarily setting up camp in Facebook and on Tumblr and Twitter. We had never been comfortable with Web 2.0 so maybe we were secretly hoping that it would go away while we were "underground" and that something new would offer new opportunities. This doesn't seem to have happened yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, and probably most importantly, we had said what we wanted to say. After publishing a new blog post, it often felt like we were saying the same thing in yet another way. The blog format is deceiving in this aspect because all posts are dated. But many of the posts we made years ago are still very relevant today. They are by no means obsolete. So we'd encourage everyone to <a href="http://tale-of-tales.com/blog/2010/04/01/closing-the-blog/#more-4669" target="_blank">read them again</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also got tired of angry people posting comments. They always provoked the same discussions, nitpicking about our choice of words instead of considering the gist of our ideas. We really got sick of people coming to our blog defending games because they loved playing <em>Zelda</em> when they were a child. It just wasn't constructive anymore. So we started <a href="http://notgames.org/" target="_blank">notgames.org</a> to get away from this and to have an environment where we could leave such endless discussions behind us and concentrate on moving
on, on getting things done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I guess it's not news that Internet comments can be extremely depressing. But when they happen on your own site and you're literally hosting this rubbish in your own database, it can cut deep. We just didn't need that anymore. It wasn't helpful.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9729" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="A screenshot from an old version of 8."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/8_Demo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9729" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/8_Demo.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. You've teased us with the thematic details of <em>CNCNTRIC</em> (and <em>The Book of 8</em>) by posting reference pictures to a tumblr page. Can you give us any more details about the project? Or is it all still hush-hush for now?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. It's only hush-hush because there is nothing to say. For both of these projects we felt a strong need for a separate prototyping phase because we were uncertain about how we could make these things. We still are. And [as] long as we're not certain, we can't really talk about them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>Cncntrc</em> prototype is done now but we don't know what to do with it. We were initially disappointed with the result because we felt that it didn't live up to all of the themes we wanted to deal with. After polishing, we discovered an unexpected beauty in the game, but it takes a bit of effort to reach it. And we're not sure if turning the current prototype into a full game is worth our time. Maybe we will end up publishing multiple smaller games, each inspired by one aspect of <em>Cncntrc</em>. We don't know yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Book of 8</em> is a prototype for a new game based on our first unfinished design, called <a href="http://tale-of-tales.com/8/" target="_blank"><em>8</em></a>. We had an idea how to squeeze this big production into an indie-sized package and wanted to prototype that. We've ditched this idea in the mean time, partially because of experiences with <em>Cncntrc</em>, and have started a new prototype from scratch. So far, we're extremely happy with it! Laura Raines Smith has made some wonderful animations, Kris Force is creating sound effects and Gerry De Mol will be making music. It feels like it might become a really lovely thing. We're very excited about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tumblr logs are really just practical. They're not meant to tease, just to share. We always collect large libraries of reference pictures for each project. And Tumblr offers a convenient interface for doing this. And we like working in public. We're always very open about our process. So we didn't see any problem in these Tumblr streams being accessible to everyone. And I think we also felt more comfortable sharing our thoughts by means of images (after being fed up with all the words on our main blog).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Q. And finally, what do you predict for games in the near future? An emphasis on casual games? Or perhaps social games? Or maybe more experiences that serve as an alternative to entertainment-driven engagement? Some combination of the three?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A. I don't really see an increased emphasis on casual/social games. I think what's happening is that more and more people are using computers more and more (including smartphones and tablets). They have always played games (board games, card games, games of chance, etc). And now they're playing these games on computers. Any differences have more to do with differences in social behaviour online than with the games themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't like making predictions. Because, rationally, I would have to say that nothing will change and/or that everything will get worse. Because that's what my experience in the games industry this past decade has taught me. But for me it's not about likelihood and hope. It's about necessity and possibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have a wonderful new artistic medium. It is simply our duty to explore this medium and to create beauty with it. It's not a matter of calculating whether or not this is commercially feasible or if we are dealing with the future of the industry. All that matters is that we have to find a way to do this work. The potential is there, everyone can see it. It's up to us to figure out how to bring it out. That's what notgames is all about. And we will succeed. We're actually well on our way. Even with the slow hardware and the crude software we have to work with. Even without the genius artists we so desperately need. We are creating a new medium. A medium that perhaps has its historical roots in video-games but that will become something entirely different. Something new. A new technology, a new art from, a new millennium. We're here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ever heard of the games competition Ludum Dare?  It challenges developers to make games in 48 hours, and in the past it's been a source of some of the most creative games imaginable.  Games like <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/06/26/last-tuesday/">Last Tuesday</a> by <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/05/interview-jake-elliott-of-cardboard-computer-4028/">Jake Elliot</a> and <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2010/05/the-sunday-gaming-club-4-494/">Depict</a> from the not quite the same but similar Global Game Jam represent just some of the excellence that's come out of these quick games competitions.

Prelude of the Chambered is an entry in the most recent edition of the contest made by one Notch (you may have heard of him).  Effectively, it is a 3-D Zelda-alike, taking aesthetic cues from the first person shooters of the 90's and (you guessed it) Minecraft.

It's also a ludicrously enjoyable explorathon focusing on your escape from a pretty creepy prison.  Its mechanics square between old and new school, with a variety of collectible items for puzzle solving and loads of enemies.  It's quite good, and it's free to play <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ld48/index.html">right here!</a>  Give it a go.  It'll brighten your Monday morning.]]></content:encoded>

As the festivities at this year's <a href="http://www.gamescom.de/en/gamescom/home/index.php" target="_blank">Gamescom</a> came to a close this past Sunday in Cologne, Germany, the attendance numbers have already started coming in, and by all indications 2011 was a record year for "the world's largest trade fair and event highlight for interactive games and entertainment".

When asked about the turn out to this years event, Koelnmesse GmbH CEO Gerald Böse responed, "In a word: overwhelming!"

In all, the estimated attendance was 275,000 visitors from around the world, including 557 companines from 39 countries, and over 5,000 accredited media representives from more than 50 countries.

Which ruthless individuals won a copy of <em>Space Pirates and Zombies? </em>We picked three winners for the giveaway, two from the comments section and one from our Twitter feed. The winners either convinced us of their treacherous inclinations as a space captain candidate, tickled our funny bone, or, in the case of the Twitter feed, had lady luck smile upon their computer monitors.

So, who won?

<cite><strong>Joel Rucker</strong>; "I’d leave my crew to rot in a cruel, zombified state half eaten by aliens, having taken the contents of their pockets, and find a new crew."</cite>

It's not enough to kill your crewmates, you see. It's important that you steal from their dead, lifeless bodies, too.

<cite><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Ohbit3?feature=mhee" rel="external nofollow"><strong>Ohbit3</strong> ;</a> "I would travel to Mount Everest where at a phone booth will be a man in a black suit. I will tell him that I must contact superman to fly me to his secret lair due to zombies, he will gladly escort me (in the non-sexual way) if I am willing to find a goat with black hair and raise it from exactly three weeks old to 10 months. Even though Space Zombies are rapidly approaching in their makeshift UFOs I will accept his deal and go off on an adventure to raise a goat. Oh and the goat’s name shall be Mr. Fluffle-muffins. That’s how far I would go." </cite>

Ohbit, you tapped into my non sequitur brand of humor. Any chance you might like Adventure Time, too?!

And, lastly, from our Twitter feed!

<em><strong>David Hughes</strong>; "Space PIRATE Zombies."</em>

That answer is in response to 'Which is cooler, space pirates or space zombies'? And, looks like he nailed it, too: neither of those is as cool as both of those at once!

If you won, make sure to get into contact with us somehow (email, Twitter, corn field messages) so that we may send you your code! And, of course--thanks to everyone who entered!

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.roflgames.com/DPadWebsite/www/OwlboyWebsite/index.htm" target="_blank"><em>Owlboy</em></a>, as you might have guessed, stars an anthropomorphic owl. This creature, named Otus, has large, robust wings that give him the ability to fly. And unlike many other platformers where flight is time-limited or restricted to just gliding, etc, Otus never has to pause for a break, allowing players to fly as far and as high as they want. If you're familiar with <em>Rayman</em> (not the <em>Rabbid</em> party games, I mean the original 2D platformer first released on the PlayStation 1 way back in 1995), then parts of <em>Owlboy</em> will seem eerily reminiscent of the spiked-filled super helicopter parts of the Blue Mountain World. For the most part though, <em>Owlboy</em> plays more like <em>Aquaria</em> and <em>Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet</em>, games where players use their freedom of mobility to explore environments, solve puzzles and defeat enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In <em>Owlboy</em>'s case, Otus' freedom of mobility is counterbalanced by him not being a strong combatant. He has a melee attack, but it's fairly weak, so most of the fighting is done by one of his gunner allies. Your first gunner (of which there are two in this demo) is a blaster-wielding mechanic named Geddy. Geddy's personality fits a common smart guy archetype, but I was immediately drawn to making particular comparisons to Bentley the Turtle from <em>Sly Cooper</em>. Both are good with tools, both use a projectile-based weapon, both prominently display green clothing, both value brain over brawn, both are prone to fits of cowardice and so on. Your second gunner is far more powerful and effective than Geddy (and has their own host of personality quirks), but you only acquire their assistance late in the demo. As such, I'll avoid spoiling the identity of the second gunner and just let you enjoy the surprise when you get there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I brought up <em>Rayman</em> earlier because the further I progressed, the more I felt like <em>Owlboy</em> draws inspiration from games in that series (or whatever games the <em>Rayman</em> franchise drew inspiration from). Much of the <em>Owlboy</em> demo takes place in a temple riddled with enemies and environmental puzzles that wouldn't feel out of place in <em>Rayman 2</em>. Beyond that, the main antagonists of <em>Owlboy</em> seem to be a bunch of quirky pirates... who would fit right in with the quirky pirate antagonists of <em>Rayman 2</em>!</p>


[caption id="attachment_9774" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Also, come on, you can&#039;t tell me the guy on the right doesn&#039;t look like Admiral Razorbeard, the big bad of Rayman 2, if he was more rotund and vaguely Shakespearean."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_Razorbeard.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9774 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_Razorbeard.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">It could just be a coincidence though; the <em>Rayman</em> franchise has covered a wide range of platformer tropes, so it's quite possible that the similarities were not intentional and that I'm reading too much into it. The demo is too short for me to make a definite judgment, so I suppose I'll just have to wait for the full release of <em>Owlboy</em> to see whether or not my suspicions ring true. In the meantime, let's get back to analyzing the demo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you've guessed that the ability to fly indefinitely circumvents the typical structure of a ground-bound platformer, you'd be right. Otus can run and jump like any other platforming protagonist, but since flight is almost always safer, faster, and unlimited, why bother? Unfortunately, a design decision essentially forces (or at least strongly encourages) typical running and jumping play by temporarily introducing some restriction. The demo provides two examples of such restrictions: waterfalls that inhibit flight and vicious gnomes that pursue Otus if he dares fly in their presence. I emphasize unfortunate because the sections where these restrictions are found are short to the point of being almost arbitrary. Additionally, being restricted to running and jumping in a game boasting the gift of flight feels like the shackles of convention at worst and an annoyance at best, but never something that unequivocally adds value. If we must have these restrictions, then waterfalls and stealth sections work for now, but I hope I don't see these ideas beat into the ground with repetition in the future.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9775" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="In this game, gnomes are kind of like the Zork&#039;s grues, though also somewhat like the inverse since you&#039;re safe in darkness and need to stay out of the light."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_ZorkGnomes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9775 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_ZorkGnomes.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The generic enemies are easy to defeat and drop items used for healing and buffing stats. I found the drop frequency too generous overall, but this might have been tweaked specifically for the demo. The boosts from the drops are moderately useful, but the most useful supplies seem to come from a shopkeeper found in the very first area of the demo. The shop trades items for traditional coins, but the method by which Otus acquires these coins is quite atypical. Instead of finding coins in treasure chests or from defeated enemies, they're collected by flying through rings found throughout the environment. Why they are there and how they give you coins isn't explained, but at least they let you use nifty items like the Canteen (which refills your health) and Geddy's hat (which allows bullets to travel a little faster).</p>


[caption id="attachment_9776" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Despite the fact that they don&#039;t give you coins, there are still treasure chests in the game. The two that I found just gave Otus a health refill, which is disappointing considering that you can get the exact same thing for finding one of the save spots."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_TreasureChest.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9776 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_TreasureChest.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The baddies are just minor speed-bumps along your path, so puzzles and boss battles are where you'll test your mettle. The puzzles are simple to figure out due to the limited number of actions one can perform but also because the steps necessary to complete them are always logical. There's a strange predilection for using water and clouds in the puzzles, but it could just be a theme for the showcased temple.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9777" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="There&#039;s one and only one puzzle that I found to be an exception, and I&#039;m not proud to admit that it took me a disproportionately long time to figure out what I was supposed to do here."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_WaterPuzzle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9777 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_WaterPuzzle.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">I don't know how indicative the demo is of the final product, but it looks like there will be dissonance between the difficulty of boss battles and the levels in which they are found. The first boss of the demo is a cakewalk, but the second was intense (even with the stronger second gunner) and forced me to use up a number of stocked items just to survive the onslaught of bats out of hell that swarmed me during both stages of the fight. Considering the precedent that <em>Owlboy</em> had established up to that point, I was definitely not prepared for this radical spike in difficulty.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9778" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="There&#039;s also technically a third boss, though it looks more imposing than it actually is and the demo ends before you get to properly fight or escape it."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_DatsHuge.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9778 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_DatsHuge.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The <em>Owlboy</em> demo is merely a bite-sized piece of content; I got my toes wet with varied gameplay and characters, but it all ended before I felt immersed. Nothing wowed me, but nothing repulsed me either. From what was there, I was most intrigued by the possibility of a ternary dialogue / reaction system, but its utility is currently limited to dialogues about saving your game, so it's unknown how much or how little of an impact it will have on the rest of the narrative. Simply put, I'd need to see more before I could make a more definitive value judgment. As of now, <em>Owlboy</em> has piqued my interest, but it hasn't set the hook in me just yet.</p>


[caption id="attachment_9779" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="I&#039;ve held back until now, but I should mention that a talking fish with a top hat saves your game. If nothing else, the sheer strangeness of this character has me interested in learning more about the world of Owlboy."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_GoodDayToYouSir.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9779 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Owlboy_GoodDayToYouSir.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption] ]]></content:encoded>

Hello y'all! Yes, you, the person reading these words. There are two of you, which is why I'm responding to you in the plural. Two of you right there LOOK BEHIND YOU!

Ahem.

We here at Nightmare Mode have a lot of cool things to offer you in the near future, and the first of these things is our new weekly feature, where we're going to step out of our ivory towers, open up the floor, and see what you all think about stuff.

This week's topic for discussion: <strong>What is your favorite moment involving a video game?</strong>

Can be anything, from a particularly cool part of a game to that time you screwed your best friend over in Civilization to that time you waited in line for eight hours to get the first copy of Halo 3 at a midnight release. Though that might be a bit sad.

So, yeah! Jump to it in the comments. We'll be here. Watching. Or, no, wait, it doesn't say watching on the script. It says participating. Sorry about that. It's hard to read the script sometimes.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, this looks familiar! :D 

Personally one of my favourite gaming moments came from my testing days. A dozen of us were playtesting the team multiplayer component of Commandos: Strike Force on the Xbox. Another guy had dropped a molotov cocktail in a narrow corridor, effectively blocking off the route to him and giving him time to reload safely. Or so he thought until I leapt like a crazy man through the six-foot patch of fire and plugged him in the head with a single burst of Thompson fire before landing safely. Apparently it was even cooler from his perspective. 

Just goes to show that even mediocre games like CSF can produce some unique, memorable moments. And that's why even though this isn't my favourite gaming moment or anecdote, it is one that I like to bring up because it highlights one of the unique strengths of gaming as a medium. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

From atmosphere to the ability, potentially, for these experiences to <i>teach</i> us through this immersion, it's been a really significant feature of many games this generation, and I can only hope it continues in the future.

I don't mean to advertise here but one example was an experience I had with <i>Red Dead Redemption</i>, in which I wrote about how that game's weather systems made way for an <a href="http://raptured-reality.blogspot.com/2010/10/moments.html" rel="nofollow">incredible moment</a>. I also wrote about moments <a href="http://raptured-reality.blogspot.com/2011/08/metroid-marathon-metroid-primes-magic.html" rel="nofollow">again</a> for my most recent post, this time involving my favourite game <i>Metroid Prime</i>. 

Again, I don't mean to advertise but the point is that I have many moments and like to contemplate them afterwards, of which the above two posts are just some examples.

I could provide many more, if you wish, but this comment is already long enough I think. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After giving some love to only a singular game before (and after seeing someone else do a list), I feel inclined to make my own epic list. Hopefully I'm not stealing anyone's thunder here.

- Defeating Fire Leo of Viewtiful Joe on Ultra V-Rated mode.

- After so many claustrophobic environments, finally getting to see the Hanging Waters in Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future.

- Large swathes of Iji, but the final boss fight with General Tor was particularly great.

- The ending of Klonoa 2, because also any other part this game narrative that genuinely elicited tears from me.

- Pretty much all of Waterloo World in Psychonauts.

- Finally getting 100% on the Hunted by Microlites level in Stuntman. It's one of the extremely rare times where I broke a controller out of frustration beforehand.

- Defeating Space Mama in Rayman.

- The "Good" ending of Eversion, especially since the interpretation of the scene shifts so much when only one change was made from the "Bad" ending.

- The trickery necessary to defeat the final boss of Depict1 (and the boss' monologue).

- The Shark Attack bonus level of Treasures of the Deep, for its sheer uniqueness. (Made significantly better with time extending cheats!)

- The fact that Valve anticipated players getting stuck in certain parts of Portal and creating escape hatches for those parts. Also, some of the really creative solutions Portal players came up with from limited resources.

- Sparing Darko Brevic in GTA IV.

- Getting the Neighborhood Watch achievement for Half-Life 2: Episode 2.

- The Painter boss of Castle Crashers.

- Needing to fail a string of quick-time events in Indigo Prophecy (aka Fahrenheit) in order to get a good result.

- The first 30 minutes or so of Brutal Legend. (Basically everything up until you make it to the mainland.)

- Various chunks of Metal Gear Solid 3, but especially anything and everything about The End and The Sorrow.

- The Captain Qwark vid-comics of Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal.

That's a good taste for the moment!]]></wp:comment_content>

Hopefully I'm not stealing anyone's thunder here.

- Defeating Fire Leo of Viewtiful Joe on Ultra V-Rated mode.

- After so many claustrophobic environments, finally getting to see the Hanging Waters in Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future.

- Large swathes of Iji, but the final boss fight with General Tor was particularly great.

- The ending of Klonoa 2, because also any other part this game narrative that genuinely elicited tears from me.

- Pretty much all of Waterloo World in Psychonauts.

- Finally getting 100% on the Hunted by Microlites level in Stuntman. It's one of the extremely rare times where I broke a controller out of frustration beforehand.

- Defeating Space Mama in Rayman.

- The "Good" ending of Eversion, especially since the interpretation of the scene shifts so much when only one change was made from the "Bad" ending.

- The trickery necessary to defeat the final boss of Depict1 (and the boss' monologue).

- The Shark Attack bonus level of Treasures of the Deep, for its sheer uniqueness. (Made significantly better with time extending cheats!)

- The fact that Valve anticipated players getting stuck in certain parts of Portal and creating escape hatches for those parts. Also, some of the really creative solutions Portal players came up with from limited resources.

- Sparing Darko Brevic in GTA IV.

- Getting the Neighborhood Watch achievement for Half-Life 2: Episode 2.

- The Painter boss of Castle Crashers.

- Needing to fail a string of quick-time events in Indigo Prophecy (aka Fahrenheit) in order to get a good result.

- The first 30 minutes or so of Brutal Legend. (Basically everything up until you make it to the mainland.)

- Various chunks of Metal Gear Solid 3, but especially anything and everything about The End and The Sorrow.

- The Captain Qwark vid-comics of Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal.

		<title>Ubisoft Removes Online Authentication from From Dust</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In two weeks, at least. Yesterday, an <a href="http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/9751064939/m/1511052349">Ubisoft rep</a> posted on the Ubisoft forums that in two weeks, a patch for the game will be released that removes all forms of online authentication. The reason for the wait is because apparently saved games are stored in a cloud-based system, and not locally, which is a pretty strange thing to do.

From the post:

<i>We recognize that one of our posts in the From Dust forum regarding the need for authentication in the game was not clear. We sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding. Our tech teams are working on a patch that should release in approximately two weeks that will eliminate the need for any online authentication. This development time is required as we are working to ensure that those who have already started the game, and who’s progress is currently saved on our servers, will receive and save their game information locally. Once the patch is ready, players who already have the game will automatically receive the update on their next login and subsequent game sessions will be 100% offline.</i>

Anyway, yeah. Ubisoft listened and removed the DRM. Hopefully they do the same with <i>Driver: San Francisco</i> and actually <i>remove</i> the DRM, not <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/ubisoft-changes-driver-san-francisco-drm-9533/">slightly change</a>. Of course, none of this would be happening if they just simply didn't include the DRM in the first place, but progress is progress I suppose. Even if it's progress to how things were in the past.

Hopefully this is the start of a future where Ubisoft games don't have always-online DRM or online checks every time you start a game.

<em>Raventhorne</em>, the first game of this summer's <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/indie-games-summer-uprising-hotter-than-the-sun-8690/">Xbox Live Indie Uprising event</a>, feels something like that kid in high school who was brilliant in math, except he's in English class.  It's a game that manages to hit something exceptionally out of the park, and does enough to make it a title with <strong>niche </strong>appeal, but deep down it's a little out of its element.

The game does have one claim to fame: its graphics, done by deviantart artist <a href="http://animastur.deviantart.com/ ">animastur</a>, are pretty phenomenal.  The art is lush and reminiscent of previous Norse 2D beat 'em up <em>Odin Sphere</em>, which makes it a pleasure to look at.  Unfortunately, it's not all bells and whistles with the graphics: an overabundance of particle effects and some occasional sketchy animation detracts from their beauty.

Where <em>Raventhorne </em>really shines is in its mechanics.  Not in actually playing it, but in its mechanics.  In practice <em>Raventhorne </em>tries to be a hefty brawler filled with deliberate action—a 2D <em>Demon Souls</em>, if you will.  It takes a very traditional brawler structure and adds a number of interesting complications.  You have a stamina meter, which prevents you from just charging in and pressing X fourteen times to end every encounter.  You don't stun enemies as you hit them, which means that you need to make focused, aggressive strikes at the enemies in theory.

The best mechanic in the game is its timed blocking.  Here's how it works: when you block an enemy, a normal block consumes stamina.  Enemies will hit through it, fairly frequently.  The only way around this is to time your block so that you start blocking right when the enemy attacks; doing so adds another particle effect to the field (seriously, I cannot emphasize enough just how many particle effects there are in this game) and it makes you temporarily invulernable, enabling you to waltz in and wail on your enemies for a while.  It's a very satisfying mechanic, and it's great when it works well.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Raventhorne2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Raventhorne2.jpg" alt="" title="Raventhorne2" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9838" /></a>

Sounds good so far?  Well, that's when the Fun Bandits show up to steal all your fun.  Sorry.  It's a damn shame, because the mechanics are good enough to promise a compelling game.

The core problem that <em>Raventhorne </em>has is that the game is designed in a way to minimize how much fun its weighty mechanics could be.  Enemies hit you very satisfyingly, they can knock you back, but you cannot knock them back.  You can counter this by blocking, but then it never feels like anyone's actually doing any damage, and it gives the battles the feeling that you're just pressing X to raise a number until it gets big enough to make that bastard stop hitting you.

That could be surmountable, but the level design isn't.  The nasty problem with having such detailed background work is that you really can't have it both ways: it's either beauty of good game design.  This game picked beauty, and as a result every fight takes place in the same location: a large flat plain.  There's no dynamism to it.  It's doing the same thing over and over.  Even worse are the flying enemies.  The developers came up with this brilliant blocking mechanic, and then designed encounters where every enemy is a flier who shoots projectiles at you; the core blocking mechanic doesn't work with projectiles.  <em>Raventhorne </em>becomes a game where you tank projectile attacks to block the attacks of the guys on the ground to kill them, and when they die it becomes a game about awkwardly jumping, hitting X once, watching the flier fly away, and chasing him. 

You will do this about ten times per flier, because every enemy in the game has about twice as much health as they should.  Every encounter is a slog.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Raventhorne3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Raventhorne3.jpg" alt="" title="Raventhorne3" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9839" /></a>

I feel bad saying it, but <em>Raventhorne</em>, in general, is a slog.  There's a story, but the less said about it the better.  It's not a terrible premise, but it's poorly written, reliant on deus ex machina moments (hey, this character has shown up for no reason!  He can't possibly be a villain, can he?), and not integrated into the fighting at all.  Enemies are fighting you, but there's really no reason for them to.  They're fighting you because this is a brawler, and you fight enemies in this type of game.

I said in the beginning this is a niche game, and people who love brawlers will find <em>Raventhorne </em>more serviceable than I have.  There's some cool ideas, a little bit of punishing difficulty (more SNES than NES, and if you like brawlers you will understand this comparison), and a lot of really excellent art.  It's a game that got away from its developers a little bit, but it's not entirely unenjoyable to the right person.  For someone like myself, however, I found myself terribly frustrated about halfway through, praying for deliverance.

		<title>A protagonist is NOT you</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/a-protagonist-is-not-you-9846/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Most protagonists are empty, hollow shells in need of something to fill them. Thus was our verdict, as handled by our own <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/a-protagonist-is-you-9221/" target="_blank">Stefan Samurai</a> (this is the link to which this article is a response, by the way... CLICK IT!).</p>


[caption id="attachment_9850" align="alignright" width="421" caption="He&#039;s the Chosen One because he&#039;s so special"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tp-darknuts-dumb.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9850   " style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tp-darknuts-dumb.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="580" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">What followed, however, was an intriguing proposition, one that put the blame on us rather than on the developers. If protagonists are empty, that’s only because we, the players, failed to fill in this void with our imagination. In other words, all protagonists that lack development are not actually characters per se, but rather avatars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It does make sense to some degree. For example, those of us who played the original Mario and Zelda without reading any of the stories in their respective manuals would indeed take these two guys fighting lizards to rescue their beloved as mere avatars. In fact, most of the narrative in those two games came from outside the game. Back in the day, only the ones who have either read the game’s instructions or finished <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> would actually know that Mario was trying to save a Princess named Toadstool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It’s natural that we let our imagination try to fill voids ignored by narrative. Many current games, like <em>Canabalt</em>, still work like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Things are different, however, when we have protagonists living in a world filled with narrative. In those cases there will always be a context against which a protagonist will be judged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Why would he be judged in the first place? Because we are assuming something called emergent narrative is always, ALWAYS! at play whenever a game is played.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And how can an avatar be judged? By his looks? He may not have any. By his thoughts? Protagonists without proper characterization might not even give the impression to think in the first place. The remaining answer? His actions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now this is troubling, because now we are dealing with player agency. How much agency should we give the player? Give the player too much agency and he becomes The World's Biggest Asshole. The World's Biggest Asshole is that guy who invades your home and breaks your pots, casually kills people in Jerusalem, steals your car and ram it into a helicopter for no reason whatsoever. Too much freedom and not many clear and convincing goals cause this.</p>

<div>
<p style="text-align: justify">A clever design will take this into account when making the game. If the gamer makes act a law-breaking dick, that’s because Tommy is a dick to begin with. This won’t change no matter how much you try to infuse your own imagination to fill the void of an empty character. A not so clever design will make people scratch their heads: why would Cole Phelps drive like a maniac when he is serious about the law?</p>

<div>
<p style="text-align: justify">Give the player with too little agency and he becomes The Village Idiot. Too many goals and too little freedom to do anything else cause this. In games, the Village Idiot is not retarded or crazy per se, but of such an incredible naiveté and intransigent narcissism that he truly believes he is the Chosen One and that the world would fall apart without him. People easily recognize his weakness and ask him favors they could perfectly do it themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The prime example for The Village Idiot are, again, the Zelda games – or rather what the Zelda games have become. In them, Link is a man of obvious emotions because he should only be reflecting what the gamer was obviously supposed to feel. After all, as Stefan has correctly stated, Link is always designed to work as an avatar. But that never works! Because our protagonist is only a reactor, this will place the burden of the entire game on the NPCs’ shoulders – and thus we judge Link by the very problematic relationship he was with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9976 alignleft" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/worlds-biggest-asshole-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />
This will take place regardless of whether you try to fill the void left by writers with your own imagination. Whenever writers leave an empty character in the hopes we treat them as an avatar, but forgets the fact the game happens to have narratives, that character will always fall somewhere between the Idiot-Asshole spectrum. That will become its characterization. However, note, that is not the same as saying this character is developed in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Character development happens when change in involved. Basically, when you start the game playing one person and, by the end of the game, this person has changed. It is another person. Sure, you can still interpret Link’s actions any way you want, but that still won’t make him a developed character, for Link’s actions never changed: he will still be running fetch quests for Gorons or whatever.<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9975 alignright" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/village-idiot-150x138.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="138" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There is one game, however, that manages to marry narration with the idea of an avatar most intriguingly. In <em>Half-Life 2</em>, we play as Gordon Freeman. Like Link, he is designed as a blank slate - one that games can project themselves and relate to. But unlike Link, we don’t complain about Gordon lacking in characterization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And that’s because Gordon Freeman was <em>written</em> as an avatar. The only times Gordon Freeman, the character, is awake is when the game is on. There is nothing Gordon knows but you don’t, and vice-versa. In fact, Gordon doesn’t even age when you are not playing the game. In between games he is always either knocked out or placed in a mandatory form of stasis by the G-Man. That is the genius of the G-Man figure. The G-Man embodies the game contract. He is also an entity of whom other characters are fully aware. There is a most revealing piece of information that is revealed by Dr. Breen near the end of <em>Half-Life 2</em>. Supposedly, Gordon’s “contract was open to the highest bidder”. This is most likely the contract which Gordon has with the G-man and, therefore, us. After all, we bought the game. We were the ones that gave the winning bid… at Gamestop!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9847" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/coolface_280.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" />Gordon Freeman is the one free exception to the rule. He truly is an avatar living in a narrative-filled world – because he was written to be one! The other protagonists are not avatars. You are not them. They are not you.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gabe Newell surprised a lot of people when he showed up at Sony's E3 keynote last year and announced that <em>Portal 2</em> would be available on PS3 with Steamworks. Valve are looking to continue that relationship with<em> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> early next year.

Speaking to <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/features/1399/Gabe-Newell-on-Valves-new-horizons" target="_blank">Develop</a> at Gamescom where the game was previewed for the first time, Newell spoke of the benefits both parties have reaped from Valve's partnership with Sony.

"With the release of the first <em>Portal 2</em> DLC people will really see the value of Sony allowing Steam to be released on their system. We can patch and update regularly, and I think not only us but other developers are benefiting from Sony’s approach," said Newell.

"I think Sony will start to benefit from what it’s doing. They’ve done the scary thing and I think it’s up to us as developers to make sure Sony and its customers are rewarded," he continued.

When asked about <em>Dust 514</em>, the PS3 companion to CCP Games' MMO<em> Eve Online, </em>Newell spoke of the need to encourage an open platform.

"We and other developers have to show we’re creating value to Sony for opening up its network. We have to show them it’s a smart business move.

"We need to reward Sony for making this decision. We need to prove Sony is right."

Valve have a less affable relationship with Microsoft, notorious for its tight control over updates and downloadable content on the Xbox 360. PC favorite <em>Team Fortress 2</em> and the <em>Left 4 Dead</em> franchise have received dozens of free updates on PC through Steam, but the 360 version of TF2 remains untouched and hatless since 2007, while users had to pay for the campaigns added to the <em>Left 4 Dead</em> series. The developer did however managed to negotiate free DLC for <em>Portal 2</em> to both consoles, which will arrive in September.]]></content:encoded>

<img class="size-full wp-image-9904 aligncenter" style="border-width: 2px;border-color: black;border-style: solid" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/feature.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="325" /></a></p>
When I think of simplicity, I find myself recalling my childhood. It is easy to fall into nostalgia for those stress-free days of playground Pokemon battles, underground baseball card sales, and game design sessions. I am sure that I was not the only aspiring developer who spent hours conceiving of characters, levels, and weapons for their arcade fighting blockbuster, roleplaying epic, or frantic first-person shooter. I never merely "played" designer; these were games that I was going to make. Unaware of the artistic, technical, and (as should never be underplayed) motivational challenges of game development, I was free to imagine video games ridiculously ambitious in scale without an inner voice reminding me to be realistic; the concept of "ambition" was itself foreign to me. I've often wondered how my earliest games would have played, if I had held the power to create them. With this in mind, I sprang on an opportunity to design and teach a game development class at an elementary school summer program.

Using <a href="http://www.silvercreator.net/" target="_blank">SilverCreator</a>, a Mac-based Hypercard-esque program, I (and Ernst Angrand, my co-teacher) introduced groups of third, fourth, and fifth graders to basic game development. I felt that the adventure game format would offer the best balance of design flexibility and development difficulty, so I guided the students through the creation of graphical adventure games. SilverCreator programs are organized into cards: separate game "screens" that provide graphics and text contexts as well as interactable buttons. Given my instruction, the only player input students could harness was a click of such buttons. Buttons could be designed to quit the game, progress a story by displaying another card, play a sound effect, or do nothing. In this format, creating a complex adventure game with branching story paths is exponentially more difficult than developing a simpler game. From one card, different options lead the story through different cards, each of which presents its own options; the work of building the game is thus exponential. While teaching the class, I observed how students conceived of and implemented adventure games: while often frustrated in their efforts to create complex stories, many put limited mechanics to intriguing use, creating engaging meta and social gameplay within simple games.

At first, simplicity didn't seem very appealing. Many students imagined deviously complex stories, only to be frustrated once they discovered how difficult they would be to develop. One group of third graders proudly showed me the first scene in their game, <em>Death World vs. Good World</em>: "You meet a bad guy what do you do? He lives in the dark world and you live in the good world." The player could 'stab,' 'shoot,' 'punch,' or 'bomb' the bad guy. I clicked 'shoot.' Nothing happened. I tried 'punch.' Still nothing. Crestfallen, one of the students exclaimed, "you mean all of those buttons are supposed to do something!?" Some groups got around this issue by railroading the player along a predetermined path. In Ninjas and Snakes (a fourth grade project), for example, punching, bombing, and stabbing your evil twin brother all have the same effect; you defeat him and unlock your super power. Some made their games totally linear. The most disturbing example of this trend is <em>Jaden Smith Marriage</em>, a fifth grade game in which you MUST marry Jaden Smith. There is no way out.

[caption id="attachment_9997" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="Free will is an illusion"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/elementary-game-development-9892/ninjas-and-snakes-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-9997"><img class="size-full wp-image-9997" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ninjas-and-snakes.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></a>[/caption]

Despite the apparent temptation to employ some unsavory game design practices, many students embraced their limitations. Instead of trying to force complex stories onto basic mechanics, they retained simplicity in developing engaging meta and social experiences. To expand upon the former: some groups created "games within their games." In <em>Death World vs Good World</em>, players were initially annoyed by the majority of the buttons' lack of interactivity. The students solved this problem simply and brilliantly - they applied amusing sound effects to the inactive buttons. Now, while shooting, punching, or bombing the bad guy does nothing to complicate the game's plot, players click away, giggling as gunshots, impacts, and explosions blend into a cacophony of violence. It isn't too surprising that the school deemed <em>Death World</em> too violent to publish online, actually. Another third grade project, <em>The Adventures of Reyana and Gabriella</em>, uses sound to a similar effect. When the two titular characters are chased by goblins, the player has the option to 'scream' or 'run.' Clicking 'scream' does just that - the game lets out an ear-splitting shriek befitting an encounter with goblins. While this button does nothing to progress (and therefore complicate) the game's story, most players clicked it a few times before running away from the goblins. The noise level in the computer lab was at times painful, I will admit, but the students had discovered an ingenious method of engaging players though simplicity, rather than at its expense.

[caption id="attachment_9999" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="Download this game and &quot;horror scream.&quot; Then imagine six other computers screaming in unison at full volume"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/elementary-game-development-9892/reyana-and-gabriella-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-9999"><img class="size-full wp-image-9999" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/reyana-and-gabriella.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></a>[/caption]

Other groups preserved both player interest and simplicity by adding a social element to their games. In <em>The Prince and Princess</em>, a third grade project, the inept adventurer may fail to save the princess from a group of monsters. "Oh no! The princess has been killed. Try again." Players may 'retry,' 'do nothing,' or 'go crazy.' Choosing 'do nothing' does just that. While the unfortunate hero onscreen is unsure how exactly to 'go crazy,' enthusiastic players are happy to demonstrate. The reader may imagine the chaos of a computer lab full of third graders all giving their best impression of insanity. Ernst and I found the situation a bit anarchic, but the students clearly had fun. In <em>The Princess and the Super Hero</em>, a fourth grade project, victorious players win the princess' heart: "You saved my life handsome boy thank you cutie." They can either 'leave' or 'do the boogy dance.' Both options quit the game, but only one inspires a group of cooped-up fourth graders to dance frantically. Many of the player's options in games such as <em>The Prince and Princess</em> and <em>The Princess and the Super Hero</em> are astonishingly simple. Technically, they at most quit the game, and several do nothing at all. However, their effect upon players is impressive - they allow the game to spread from the virtual into the material world, inviting players to revel in good-old fashioned physical social gameplay. You might have experienced this when you were a child. It is usually referred to, quite simply, as 'play.'

[caption id="attachment_9998" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="&quot;Boogy dancing&quot; alone in front of your computer is fine too"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/elementary-game-development-9892/princess-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-9998"><img class="size-full wp-image-9998" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/princess.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></a>[/caption]

Limitation, they say, breeds creativity. When it comes to game development, I cannot imagine a more limiting position than the one in which I placed my students: I expected them to create games with only a basic card-based development tool and an elementary schooler's knowledge of engineering. Even so, students could attempt complex projects; adventure games with branching story paths. The extent to which students realized the futility of attempting to create complicated games surprised me. I was impressed further by the ways in which they compensated for this barrier, keeping their games simple and engaging players through meta and social gameplay. It was at first difficult for me to imagine my first game designs being realized in such a manner. Their mechanics were too fantastically complex and their scope too broad, it seemed. However, I've come to realize that with some creativity and perhaps a bit of naivety, games can be dramatically simplified without sacrificing their capacity to amuse and engage. Back in third grade, I could very well have done it - and older game designers should be aware of the powers of simplification.

In a previous article, I presented a sort of manifesto of Absurdist game design (http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/arcade-of-the-absurd-6343/). There, I argued that the main tenant of Absurdism (all ideals and attempts at perfection are ultimately pointless, so one should value the simplicity and reality of life over any quest for completion) can be integrated into video games by counting on counter-procedural mechanics to engage players.

And his beau, the beautiful Miss Wu, delves deeper into the mysteries of the now even more flooded corpse of Rapture.  And next week, tune in for the bathhouse episode!</em>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/episode_head.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/episode_head.jpg" alt="" title="episode_head" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9966" /></a>

When we talk about episodic games, it's usually in hushed, slurred voices, our words vile slanders.  Episodic gaming is shit.  That's the refrain.

As an idea, it's good: tap into the idea well of television, and tell stories that break down into smaller, easily digestible elements.  On the development side, it makes game development costs more manageable by splitting the work up over time, and by creating a constant stream of revenue rather than making all the money at the end.  Furthermore, changes can be made based on fan feedback on earlier episodes, resulting in more polished experiences.  In general, episodic gaming allows for better games, both in terms of easing development and allowing for different plots to be told.

Yeah, it hasn't worked out that way.  The most famous watermark for episodic games, <em>Half Life 2</em>, stopped literally mid-sentence on Episode Two, with no conclusion forthcoming.  Countless indies have released episodes of games and then never continued the series due to lack of fan support; some of these games might have had greater success if they were released as whole, complete objects.

On the successful side, though, we've had the Sam and Max series, which has gone for three seasons and has, regrettably, run into the problem that television shows do in later seasons: it's gotten old.  The first season was a well-balanced affair where it really felt like a paced television show, but the later seasons have been less cohesive and less impressive.  Furthermore, we've seen some games like <em>Disgaea </em>which have attempted to be episodic in structure but which, obviously, aren't episodic in release.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/episode_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/episode_2.jpg" alt="" title="episode_2" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9967" /></a>

So how can episodic games truly work?  

<em>This week on Super Mario Brothers Super Adventure, Mario visits the Ice Kingdom and Luigi teaches a lecture at the Mario  Bros. Soccer Academy!  And Birdo's got a big surprise for Yoshi...!</em>

The most compelling aspects of an episodic structure lies in the ability to combine disparate ideas with a central unity.  That is, each episode can tell its own independent story while remaining a part of a bigger whole.  For instance, look at a television show like <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>.  Episodes feature massive internal tonal shifts: some are silly, some are deadly serious, some highlight action-packed kung-fu segments, and others have a lot of talking without much punching.  They jump around between characters, try different things, and provide the viewer with variety, all building up to its point at the end.

<em>Sam and Max </em>had the major story arc, but it didn't have the variety.  The problem was that these stories were all the same: crimefighting duo finds a wacky situation, wises are cracked, and in the end the villain is defeated while another villain looks on.  Cue evil laugh and credits scene backed by jazz.  It's a decent structure, but it is predictable and provides the player with little variety.  We love repetition, but we need a certain degree of variety, a variety <em>Sam and Max </em>didn't offer after its first season.  For example, the most memorable games in the classic King's Quest series were three, five, and six, the ones that had the most variable gameplay and which provided the most novel experiences to the player inside of its general framework.  No one who's played <em>King's Quest II </em>particularly remembers it, but they all remember the third game because of its unique introductory structure: instead of being a king questing (hah) for his crown or his queen, instead you were a servant boy at the whim of an evil magician.  The structural variance made it a more exciting experience.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Episode_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Episode_1.jpg" alt="" title="Episode_1" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9968" /></a>

An episodic game can shine by offering its player varied experiences; we know this from games like <em>L.A. Noire</em>, the most prominent recent game with this sort of structure.  Episodic releases, so far, has provided more of the same.  You buy the first episode, and if it's successful enough the publisher takes it as a reason to greenlight another game with the same content but with different backgrounds.  <em>Sonic 4</em>'s first episode “succeeded”, so Sega decided to make another one.  They didn't even begin working until they realized it was a cash cow.  There's no reason for it to be an episodic series except that it gives them a good reason to make a “sequel”.

<em>Half Life 2</em>, gaming's most famous episodic series, tried to do it right, but then Valve ditched the approach for <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/features/1184/The-Valve-manifesto">shorter development cycles and creating platforms for content distribution</a>.  As it was going, <em>Half Life 2 </em>might have offered a good example of an episodic story, but it gave up the ghost too quickly.

It's hard to envision a proper episodic series because one hasn't happened yet.  Games have had well structured episodic plots, but episodic releases present major challenges to developers: it's significantly more work to make a series of episodes with varied gameplay than it is to turn a camera to another person in a television series.  You need time and focus to develop completely new sections of a video game, a new playable character, and it would be a monstrous undertaking to try to make a truly high quality episodic experience.

<em>On a very special episode of Civilization, the Huns invade the Chinese, and the French look on horrified.  Is there anything they can do to help their former allies?  Can they stop the insidious spread of Hinduism in their lands?</em>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Episode_3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Episode_3.jpg" alt="" title="Episode_3" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9969" /></a>

Where do I think that the first good episodic series will come?  I feel like an independent developer who doesn't overreach will figure this out and make a good, variable series.  Something like an RPG can add layers of additional content to a basic leveling system, making it consistently more complex slowly, and it wouldn't be very difficult to add in new characters.  This is just speculation, but it seems to me that an episodic RPG in the Japanese tradition could do wonders to revive the genre.

Paradoxically, I think <em>Starcraft 2 </em>might also make good use of the episodic format by splitting its game up by races.  We've only played the Terran faction so far, which wasn't phenomenal, and as a whole it seems more like different seasons of a series than episodes, but it could offer enough variety to really keep each “episode” different and feeling new, which is the most important aspect of the structure.

As it is now, the episodic release structure is a good idea that hasn't been hit out of the park yet.  It's an idea ripe for use, but one where we can't cite a specific, actual example and say, "This game has made great use of the structure," which is a shame.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify">"It is like writing history with Lightning" said President Woodrow Wilson, allegedly after seeing the first screening of a movie in the White House.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">

[caption id="attachment_9978" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="Women that gaze directly into his eyes, might find themselves suddenly pregnant"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wilson.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9978 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wilson-150x112.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="112" /></a>[/caption]

As exceptional as President Wilson’s ability to conjure awesome metaphors was, his remark carried little hyperbole. By then movies were finally breaking the “movie barrier.” After decades of being little more than silent amusements to be shown in "moving picture shows," one movie finally cracked the code necessary to deliver narratives.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">The movie, the very same screened at Wilson’s abode, was D. W. Griffith’s <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>. Birth, despite being morally reprehensible now – it portrayed the KKK as heroes in a time where segregation was considered almost too progressive – was the film that invented film language as we know it.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify">It invented things we now take for granted, like the idea of telling a scene by cutting between wide and medium shots, as well as inserting close-ups and close shots of details. Griffith’s biggest innovation, however, was cross-cutting: the mechanism of a movie following parallel lines of action taking place at different locations. First, you show one group of characters, then another, then the previous group again. I cannot say what is more mind-blowing: the mechanism itself or the idea that some audience somewhere in the past once found this mind-blowing.</div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: justify">What is mind-blowing is that games have yet to discover the genius that is cross-cutting. It’s mind-blowingly weird.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9973" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/birth_of_a_nation-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" />We have captured the language of movies perfectly – and applied them only during cutscenes. How often do we jump between characters and provide the gamer with different points of view? Even Episodic Gaming, an<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/todays-episode-is-brought-to-you-by-9963/" target="_blank"> issue we have just talked about</a>, fails to make use of cross cutting even though it is the form that would most benefit from it. Let’s not put the horse before the cart, though. How can we even expect games to master cross-cutting, when they fail to present multiple points of views in general?</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify">The few times they did, however, the result was most encouraging. In <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, the franchise's best-selling game on a single platform, allowing players to finish the game first from one of the protagonist’s perspective and then complementing it with the other protagonist’s allowed Capcom to expand the game’s length without dragging out the plot. Meanwhile, the sudden change of reference at the very end of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> puts the entire narrative into a different context. The redemption so long sought by John Marston, instead of allowing his son to become a farmer like he would have wanted, made him become a gunslinger, thus perpetuating the sins that led up to that quest for redemption in the first place.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify">In fact, there is a strong interrelation between the games that allow us to assume different points of view (and just because I’m nice, I’m even counting the examples whose portrayal of different points of view is not integrated in the same single player mode, like the Separate Ways mode of Resident Evil 4) and being able to tell an engrossing tale. Examples are: <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill 2: Shattered Memories</em>, <em>Deadly Premonition</em> (yes!), <em>Heavy Rain</em>, etc.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mr-x.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9979 alignleft" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mr-x-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>And that’s the whole point, no? Video games now want to tell stories and to be recognizable as a respectful medium for story-telling – for that to happen, the “game barrier” must be broken down. That means not only lessening the reliance on the pillars of gameplay – abundance of action being repeated (the Gameplay Loop) by the same fella – but also starting to make use of tools already available to us from that veteran visual story-telling medium known as moving pictures.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Still, even though I can see game directors that are not Hideo Kojima having trouble attempting to incorporate cross-cutting in their works, I cannot grasp why the industry hasn’t adopted the principle of using contrasting points of view for the same event, considering the costs of game development. Wouldn’t it make more sense to spare some money and, instead of building new worlds, revisit them with different characters, living different stories? I mean, the world of Hyrule is not like a set that needs to be maintained by a studio, no? Instead, I see only a handful of developers doing this; Rockstar in particular, with their DLCs. If I were Rockstar, however, I would go even further. I would no longer develop any new cities for <em>GTA</em>, <em>L.A. Noire</em>, or <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and instead only fill those spaces with lots of different tales, both big and small, being sold at extravagant or dirt cheap prices respectively. In my almost-perfect world, if there were a <em>Bioshock</em> sequel (it’s almost perfect because, in my perfect world, the original <em>Bioshock</em> would ascend to become a legend and leave no offspring behind), that sequel would present the very same spaces of the first one instead of any new areas, but from a different perspective.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Cross-cutting is an incredibly versatile technique. It is ambiguous for it suggests simultaneity between both actions, which may not be the case. It is meaningful for it can imply metaphors, contrasts, and/or parallels between the two actions being shown. It is rhythmical as the time between cuts can set the pacing of the narrative. It is suspenseful for it builds the expectation for the explanation of a scene the audience doesn’t quite comprehend at that time.</div><p>
<div style="text-align: justify">There is so much we are missing, so much money being wasted on derivations of the same story on different worlds rather than the other way around. The barrier is still ahead of us. And we are not there yet.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Simple Joy of Monster Hunter</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/the-simple-joy-of-monster-hunter-2-10016/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You arrive at the old jungle. The sun has set. Your prey only shows itself in the darkest hours of the night. Your friends are with you. You exchange confident glances and begin making your way towards the stomping grounds of the elusive Nargacuga. After quikcly dispatching of a small heard of Veoliciprey, your party stops in a moonlit clearing for a moment to sharpen their weapons and make sure their equipment is ready for the battle to come. You playfully chastise your friend who plays his hunting horn, as if you’re worried about attracting the attention of the creature likely lurking nearby. It’s quiet; few other creatures come out this late at night.

[caption id="attachment_10010" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="Kitty!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/nargacuga.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10010" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/nargacuga.jpg" alt="Picture of terrifying panther dragon." width="460" height="250" /></a>[/caption]

That’s why the sudden roar from the dark patch of trees behind the party sends chills of both excitement and terror up your spine. The Nargacuga bursts into the moonlight, raising its formidable tail and bellowing out a challenge before charging forward. The hunter in the rear of your party raises his shield and stops the beast in its tracks, following up with a blast from his gunlance (yes GUN-LANCE!). You throw a flash bomb in front of the creature, blinding it and sending it into a fury. It lashes out blindly, unable to land a swipe on any of your friends. One of them takes this opportunity to lay a pitfall trap while the others land occasional strikes on it, breaking scales off of its wings and severing the end of its tail. The Nargacuga stops for a moment and shakes its head as its vision returns before charging straight at you. You draw your impossibly massive great sword with confidence and watch the huge monster topple into the pit trap just a few feet in front of you. You grin and deal a massive blow to the creature’s head, cracking its skull. It shrieks in pain, thrashing around and still unable to escape the trap as one of your friends throws a tranquilizing bomb.

Mission accomplished.

My entire summer last year was <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite </em>with my friends<em>. </em>Two or three times a week, we'd get together in my living room with our PSP's to hunt into the wee hours of the morning. The series<em> </em>has a premise so awesome that its barely cult status in the United States baffles me to no end. This is a series about hunting down dinosaurs, dragons, and awesome mixes of the two using oversized medieval weaponry, traps, and explosives... with your friends! Every time I whack a creature a hundred times my size with a sword twice my size and watch it stagger backward roaring in pain as one of its massive horns shatters, I feel pure, fucking <em>glee. </em>I defeated this creature with my wits, weapons, skill, and pure testosterone. Nothing was scripted. I got my gear together, ventured out into the wilderness, and returned with a carcass larger than my house. Few other moments in my personal gaming history have brought such simple joy.

[caption id="attachment_10007" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="Now how do I get this home..."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Big-Monster-Hunter.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10007" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Big-Monster-Hunter.jpg" alt="Picture of pure testosterone." width="460" height="250" /></a>[/caption]

That joy is simple because <em>Monster Hunter </em>doesn't fuck around with behind-the-scenes dice rolls or spreadsheets. Everything feels exactly like it should. Just hit that triceratops-dragon with your giant hammer and watch it roar in agony. Where's your auto-target!? This ain't no MMO you pussy! You have to aim your strikes! Numbers aren't going to dodge for you! Are you hurt? Drink a potion! Of course it isn't instant! It takes a second to drink liquid from a bottle and flex your mighty muscles! That giant enemy crab isn't going to wait for you! Your flash bombs don't have a hit ratio! Throw it in the monster's face! If it doesn't work, good, now you know this monster isn't affected by them! Tired of that wyvern's wing beats knocking you off your feet? There's an armor augmentation for that! Want a bigger health meter? There's an aug for that! Sick of being damaged by puny lava? There's an aug for that! There's an aug for just about everything! Attach it to your armor and presto! It's not a percentage! It just works!

[caption id="attachment_10008" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="This guy brought the right weapon."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kutku.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10008" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kutku.jpg" alt="Picture of chicken dragon being stabbed in the neck." width="460" height="250" /></a>[/caption]

It's just refreshing to play a game in which everything is as it seems. I'm not against the hand-holding that dominates most modern games, but I can enjoy it when a game forces you to learn by doing. It can be frustrating when you realize that the weapon you brought with you is way too slow to hit your target creature, but that allows you to adapt. Setting a trap that temporarily immobilizes the monster or throwing a blinding flash bomb can create an opening for some powerful hits. Placing bombs and luring the monster into their detonation range can work as well. Hell, if you don't want to try any of that, come back with a faster weapon. Whenever I encounter a problem in <em>Monster Hunter,</em> the solution is always clear; even if that means doing some grinding.

Normally I loathe grinding, but I'm more than happy to kill monsters ad nauseum for that one special drop since it's so damned fun. Since the combat is much more entertaining and complicated than clicking on my prey and hitting a few hot keys, it can be incredibly rewarding to fight the same creature over and over again. This is especially true when you've got friends to hunt with. Eventually you'll have your group tactics down to a science. To quote a certain gentleman, "I love when a plan comes together." I've killed so many Nargacugas that I can crack one's beaky face open within ten minutes on a good hunt. For my efforts I was rewarded with armor and weapons that I crafted from its very flash and bones. It's satisfying to walk around clad in the remains of your conquered foes. Your very equipment is a testament to your exploits.

Obviously, I have a lot of good things to say about <em>Monster Hunter. </em>Unfortunately, the series has a few warts that have kept it from reaching its truly epic potential. The bar for entry is a tough one. For new hunters, you're looking at at least 20 hours before things get really interesting. With friends, it's more like an hour, but not everyone has a bunch of friends with PSP's. The controls absolutely beg for a second joystick, and with the camera controls being tied to the PSP's directional pad one must either must form a finger claw or grow a third arm. Online play is also limited to using the unwieldly Ad Hoc Party application on the PS3.

That said, the future of the series could potentially be very bright. <em>Monster Hunter Tri </em>had <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFZnZV0ZxfAE">an awesome marketing campaign</a> and was considered by many critics to be the best online experience the Wii had to offer. Sadly we're not quite there yet. The bar for entry needs to be lowered. Also, the best games in the series, including the completely online <em>Monster Hunter Frontier </em>for PC and a high definition PS3 port of <em>Monster Hunter Portable 3,</em> remain exclusive to Japan and remain unavailable to American hunters. We can't use the same arguement that the wonderful folks at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Foprainfall.blogspot.com%2F">Operation Rainfall</a> use either since <em>Monster Hunter</em> games actually do sell better in Japan than here. Petitions have come and gone, but given Capcom's recent dealings with their fans I wouldn't judge the publisher for not having anything to say on the matter.

It's a shame, but at least I still have over 50 quests to complete in <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em> in spite of the 300+ hours I've put into the game.]]></content:encoded>

You're murdering dinosaurs from day one, you just make it to the big leagues after around 20 hours.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Most of what we know about Super Monday Night Combat, we haven't seen--until now. This new trailer features some new, never-before-seen gameplay from both the new pros and old pros alike, new concept art, a new map in action, and more. Things that might be of particular interest: Pitgirl has a crazy-looking fireball, the Veteran seems to have an ice-move, the levels are looking lush and details, we see some of the new bots in action, and, we still don't know what in the world FROM ASHY TO CLASSY means.</p>

This may surprise you, but our weekly discussion post is supposed to go up on Monday every week.  Last week we had a delay for reasons I forgot about.  This week we had Irene the timehurricane.

You might be saying, "Tom, Irene was just a tropical storm.  Hell, I know for a fact that when Irene came it was so mild you went outside, tried to fly a kite, and there <em>wasn't enough wind</em>.  You're full of shit."  Well, nice try, gentle reader, but you're wrong.  You see, Hurricane Irene came, it brought with it a much more dastardly problem for the lovely little hamlet of Amherst, Massachusetts than flooding or wind or your pithy earth problems: it brought time compression.

You see, fair friends, right now it is any time between 4:35 PM Monday and 5:58 AM Wednesday here in western Massachusetts.  Truly, such a horrible fate shouldn't be wished on anyone.

But that's not why you're here!  You're here because you want to discuss something, and discuss something we will!  This week: <strong>sounds</strong>.  <strong>What's your favorite game soundtrack, song, sound, or audio-related moment?</strong>  As long as it's a noise heard through your ears or a pumping bass felt through the whole of you, we want to hear about it!  <em>Especially</em> if you want to talk about how incredible the soundtrack to <em>Chrono Cross </em>was.  That's my pick: the world map of <em>Chrono Cross</em>.  The best world map themes (and so many of them!) this side of Friday.

See!  That's how easy participation can be!  So tell us things about sounds.  Don't leave me alone, somewhere between yesterday and tomorrow, the only participator.]]></content:encoded>

- As far as entire soundtracks go, I love a number of them, but to name just a few: Castle Crashers, Iji, Kloanoa 2, Cave Story, Mirror's Edge, Treasures of the Deep, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Crash Twinsanity and LittleBIGPlanet

- Individual songs: "Monty on the Run" (aka IWBtG's "The Guy's Castle") http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93nIljXpqUY and "Drone Mile" in Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B88ZLp3Sx9k 

- Usage of sound in general: The Silent Hill series deserves praise for its excellent ambient soundwork, but I'd also want to mention Viewtiful Joe for the necessity of listening to sound cues on Ultra V-Rated as well as TES: Oblivion for its sound-based lockpicking minigame.

- Oddball mention: The GameStop Harlequin commercial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTp2REwC8oo]]></wp:comment_content>

- Oddball mention: The GameStop Harlequin commercial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTp2REwC8oo";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:5:"10044";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:1:"0";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"4354dd1000";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"Tl1BMs26rAwAAElh030AAAD5";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:10:"1291059340";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:63:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:13:"gzip, deflate";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:76:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/for-discussion-2-the-sound-of-gaming-10044/";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1183";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

But by far the best soundtrack I've heard ever (or at least so far) is the one for Bastion. Everything is simply perfect about it. It fits so perfectly to the mood of the game.]]></wp:comment_content>

Special mention goes to the loading screen music (http://hosting.raymanpc.com/raytunes/music/58%20-%20PS1%20~%20Level%20Loading.mp3 is one of the closest I could find), which didn't last nearly as long as the full track does in the actual game, but always got me pumped to face whatever new challenge awaited me.]]></wp:comment_content>

Yesterday saw the release of a <em>Dead Island</em> <a href="https://subscriptions.marvel.com/digitalcomics/view_white.htm?iid=22757" target="_blank">digital comic</a> detailing the events leading up to the deadly zombie infestation.  The story takes us on a journey following journalist Roger Howard who is investigating illegal use of the islands natural resources when he discovers something that, to say the least, he was not expecting.

Continuing the build up to retail release, today saw the debut of the <a href="http://youtu.be/5e7-fWVob00" target="_blank">official release trailer</a> which showcases some of the beautiful graphics, terrifying zombies, and lead characters of the game.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are games a power fantasy? Escapism? They allow us to almost, but not quite, become icons of the ideals we believe in. We stomp goombas on our way to save the princess, we save the world from nuclear destruction in the nick of time and we vanquish the great evil that stalks the land. But that’s a narrow-minded definition. On the other hand, when have we played as someone who was on the other side of that veil? Through history, many have found themselves on the wrong side, from the Inquisition to the Nazis, believing that their goals were the enviable ones. Goals that were worth killing and dying for. But first, let us examine what a hero really is, and why heroism is so appealing.

The definitions of the word <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fhero" target="_blank">hero</a> are many, from “illustrious warrior” and a “mythological and legendary figure…with great strength and agility.” However, the closest useable definition in our modern world has to be “one who shows great courage,” one of the greatest virtues anyone can possess. This is most often demonstrated by for instance rescue workers, who in the face of danger put their own life at risk to save the lives of others. But in the world of games, the player can sit safely behind the screen, saving the lives of innocents without risking his own skin. In other words, heroism loses its meaning in video games, but not its appeal. Who doesn't want to be hailed a hero by the cheering crowds?

The word has its origins <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHero" target="_blank">in Greek</a>, referring originally to a demigod, and only later has the role of the hero been defined as the courageous one. Although the Greek (and Roman) heroes often had some quite cruel ways, methods that today would <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kindreason.com%2Farchives%2F4heroes.htm" target="_blank">not be considered noble or heroic</a>, such as when Achilles drags Hector’s body behind his chariot, as vengeance for not being given the woman he believed he was entitled to. In addition, he also only joins the battle of Troy because he doesn’t want his men to win all the glory for themselves. As should be evident, the characteristics of the hero have changed through time, all tied closely to the social structure and ideals that ruled at the time.

[caption id="attachment_10068" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="He does look kinda like a jerk too"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achilles.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10068" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achilles.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /></a>[/caption]

Taking a look at the hero role in fiction, the American screenwriter Christopher Vogler outlined the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Writer%2527s_Journey%3A_Mythic_Structure_For_Writers" target="_blank">twelve stages of a hero’s journey</a> (although he based his model on Joseph Campbell's term "<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMonomyth" target="_blank">monomyth</a>", which <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fnightmaremode.net%2F2011%2F08%2Fa-simple-story-9082%2F" target="_blank">we've talked about previously</a>). The twelve stages can be transferred to a multitude of stories, be it legends or contemporary novels. Beginning with the hero being torn out of the ordinary world to undertake a great task, through the great “ordeal,” and ending with the hero’s return to the ordinary world, bearing a great treasure to the benefit of his fellows, the heroic arc is recognizable in many stories. Phil Leigh from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Finsidedigitalmedia.com%2Freading-versus-video-games%2F" target="_blank">Inside Digital Media</a> carries this over to the world of video games, by claiming that when gamers undertake the hero’s role in, say, Dragon Age or Call of Duty, they not only vanquish the great evil, but undergo a psychological journey that leads to “valuable psychological truths.” In essence, undertaking the hero’s role is an intensification of life.

Ultimately, the role of the hero, however appealing it is, has been done to death. More importantly, stories which branch from this paradigm are rare in the medium, which is a damn shame as it could use some deviations from the norm. These are games that show the other side of "good," and the endings aren't always happy.

[caption id="attachment_10066" align="aligncenter" width="416" caption="Even the cover art seems oddly ominous"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mafia2Cover.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10066 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mafia2Cover.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="478" /></a>[/caption]

About one year ago 2K Czech released their aptly named sequel Mafia II. Although Mafia II may not have delivered the sprawling open world some expected from it, it certainly delivered a different and nuanced protagonist. Vito Scaletta, rising from petty criminal and war veteran to the inner circle of a mafia family, doesn’t want to do the right thing or win glory. He just wants…well what does he want, other than the infinite allure of money? All of his actions stem solely from self-interest in some form or another. And isn’t that the case for most people? Even if an act may be described as self-less, like risking your life in saving someone you love, aren’t the motivations ultimately selfish? We save the person because we are in a giving relationship with the person, not because of some hidden source of goodness inside all of us.

For example, Vito routinely and unquestionably follows orders from the different mafia bosses he serves during the course of the game, even if he knows their brutal methods to be wrong. He massacres countless unlucky suckers who happened to annoy Vito’s superiors. This culminates with the ending where Vito is told to dispatch his current boss, Carlo Falcone, as he’s gotten a tip from his old friend and mentor, Leo Galante, a member of another mafia family, that Vito is walking into an ambush. With the help of another old friend, Joe Barbaro, Vito manages to take down Carlo and destroy the Falcone family. However, all is not well yet. As Leo and Vito drive from the site of the deed, the car Joe has been placed in drives off in a different direction, and Leo hints that he will be disposed of. Vito is obviously distraught, but makes no attempt to the save his friend. And then the game ends. But why doesn’t he do anything? Because he ain’t no hero, he’s human. After all, what would happen to him if he were to take over command of the car, and drive it to his friend’s rescue? He would almost certainly be killed. And throughout the game, Vito has had plenty of opportunities to leave the criminal life behind and start anew. No one’s forcing him to stay in this environment. The reason for why he stays is that the family grants him safety, community and wealth. More so than if he were to work as some underpaid laborer at the docks. Vito is no evil man, but those benefits make him ignore and endure the brutality. <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/#restored:wave:For+example%2C+Vito+routinely+and+unquestionably+follows+orders+from+the+different+mafia+bosses+he+serves+during+the+course+of+the+game%2C+even+if+he+knows+their+brutal+methods+to+be+wrong.+He+massacres+countless+unlucky+suckers+who+happened+to+annoy+Vito%E2%80%99s+superiors.+This+culminates+with+the+ending+where+Vito+is+told+to+dispatch+his+current+boss%2C+Carlo+Falcone%2C+to+the+beyond%2C+as+he%E2%80%99s+gotten+a+tip+from+his+old+friend+and+mentor%2C+Leo+Galante%2C+a+member+of+another+mafia+family%2C+that+Vito+is+walking+into+an+ambush.+With+the+help+of+another+old+friend%2C+Joe+Barbaro%2C+Vito+manages+to+take+down+Carlo+and+destroy+the+Falcone+family.+However%2C+all+is+not+well+yet.+As+Leo+and+Vito+drive+away+from+the+site+of+the+deed%2C+the+car+Joe+has+been+placed+in+drives+off+in+a+different+direction%2C+and+Leo+hints+that+he+will+be+disposed+of.+Vito+is+obviously+distraught%2C+but+makes+no+attempt+to+the+save+his+friend.+And+then+the+game+ends.+But+why+doesn%E2%80%99t+he+do+anything%3F+Because+he+ain%E2%80%99t+no+hero%2C+he%E2%80%99s+human.+After+all%2C+what+would+happen+to+him+if+he+were+to+take+over+command+of+the+car%2C+and+drive+it+to+his+friend%E2%80%99s+rescue%3F+He+would+almost+certainly+be+killed.+And+throughout+the+game%2C+Vito+has+had+plenty+of+opportunities+to+leave+the+criminal+life+behind+and+start+anew.+No+one%E2%80%99s+directly+forcing+him+to+stay+in+this+environment.+The+reason+for+why+he+stays+is+that+the+family+grants+him+safety%2C+community+and+wealth.+More+so+than+if+he+were+to+work+as+some+underpaid+laborer+at+the+docks.+Vito+is+no+evil+man%2C+but+those+benefits+make+him+ignore+and+endure+the+brutality.+And+as+already+seen+in+the+first+Mafia%2C+crime+may+pay+off%2C+but+never+abandon+or+betray+your+%E2%80%9Cfamily%E2%80%9D">And as seen in the first Mafia</a>, crime may pay off, but you never abandon or betray your “family.”

And in the world of film, protagonists do not always have to be likeable or sympathetic to be effective and nuanced. Take Wikus from District 9, for instance, who frankly is a bit of an arse in the first third of the film. Like most of the other humans, he shows little regard for the “prawns” that he has been assigned with relocating to a different location than the Johannesburg slum they occupy. He cheats them, depicts them as being horribly primitive and even kills their unauthorized young ones. Their babies! After beginning his transformation into a prawn in the second third of the film, he doesn’t have a sudden epiphany and thinks that all prawns are oh so great and should be saved from the injustice that has been committed against them. No, understandably enough he thinks about saving his own skin first and getting back to his wife. Selfish motives drive him, not altruistic ones. However, through his experiences at MNU’s labs, where the scientists were performing various experiments on the prawns, he seems to gain a greater understanding for their suffering, such as when he is faced with being forced to fire upon an unarmed prawn during a lab test with one of their fancy weapons. Instead of going through the hero’s journey as per Campbell/Vogler, Wikus, in a sense, goes through as a villain (or jerk) – victim – sympathizer journey, and maybe even achieves the role of hero, although his motives are still somewhat ambiguous. Did he really sympathize with the prawns and wish to help them, or were they just tools for his own cure?
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/WikusDistrict9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10067" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/WikusDistrict9.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="339" /></a></p>
In essence, instead of playing heroes, I want to play humans. And humans are flawed. We don’t always take the rational decision, or the good decision, as it is easy and very human to follow your desires, instincts and need for self-preservation. Those are some reasons people join extremist organizations across the political spectrum, or rabidly and fervently force some religious beliefs onto others. These people are far more interesting and deep protagonists, in that they don’t possess the mentioned idealistic trait selflessness.

So how should a truly villainous character, or just a guy caught on the wrong side, be constructed? Firstly it should be noted that the portrayal need not be a sympathetic one. Just because the protagonist is on same side as the Orcs or even the Nazis doesn’t mean that the game’s creators, or even the game’s protagonist, have the same ideals. Instead, it is a way to show an organization or a group of people, however deluded they have been, from the inside. Young Fritz gets drafted into the German Army in the beginning of the war and during the course of the game observes many atrocities committed by his own side. He would be faced with a choice. Would he abandon the relative safety of the army and desert, running from the barbarism but risking execution, or stay behind hoping that the war would end soon and he could return home? And if Fritz was a high-ranking officer instead, ordered to oversee the execution of POWs, would he do it and remain in the good favor of his superiors, or would he defy the orders? Self-preservation vs. noble goals. While most sane people would choose the latter if presented with this choice in a game, I presume most people would choose the first if they were faced with this type of situation in reality. I think such a game would be banned instantly.

Secondly, the character would need to be relatable, although I generally have only scorn for that term. Unlike the parodic characters of Dungeon Keeper and Overlord, the character would have a human aura. A human existence. Give him or her a family or a friend to protect. Something that is of greater importance to them than an unknown mass of people. And then let the player fill that character with his own motivations and ethics, but what is most important, and by far the most difficult part, is to create a significant bond between the player’s character and the supporting characters. Otherwise, there will be no remarkable effect, other than from the player’s own egoism, when the player is faced with these decisions.

This has just been a very brief look at how protagonists can evolve from the hero template that many stories follow, and evolve into something more nuanced. Being just a vast amount of calculations, the video game medium will never be able to emulate the same conflicts (that would be truly frightening too), but it is by far the ideal way of dealing with such topics, as the interactivity breeds forethought. Their lives were taken on your command. Can you live with having made such a decision?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Confirming <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/38418/Team-Bondi-releases-assets-and-IP-to-KMM" target="_blank">Develop's</a> report in early August, <em>LA Noire </em>developers Team Bondi officially entered administration as of August 30. The Australian-based developer came in to controversy after a number of former employees came forward decrying the low staff retention rate and perpetual crunch-time mode that took place over the seven-year development cycle.

Develop's report also suggested that the company's assets and staff were likely to be incorporated in to filmmaker George Miller's studio KMM, who are currently working on <em>Happy Feet 2</em>. Should that happen, McNamara would be reunited with a number of Team Bondi alumni driven away during <em>LA Noire's</em> development.

	<li>Automatic price undercutting: Set the default buyout price of your auctions to match or undercut the current lowest buyout price for an item</li>
	<li>Aggregated buyout search results: Multiple auctions posted at the same buyout price can now be viewed as a single group</li>
	<li>Support for the following Guild features: Level, Perks, Rewards, Achievements, News, Events, and MotD</li>
	<li>Links to items and achievements received in Remote Guild Chat now link to those sections in the app</li>
	<li>Links to enchants, quests, abilities, talents, and professions received in Remote Guild Chat now display tool-tips</li>
	<li>Improved search technology</li>
	<li>Search now suggests terms based on previous searches</li>
	<li>Updated calendar events presentation</li>
	<li>A character’s talents &amp; glyphs now display on the same page</li>
	<li>Leaderboard has been removed</li>
	<li>Realm firsts will no longer appear in the activity feed</li>
	<li>Bookmarks are now saved locally; all old bookmarks will be lost</li>
	<li>Various bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.square-enix.com/na/" target="_blank">Square Enix</a> has announced the upcoming release of new DLC for <a href="http://www.dungeonsiege.com/language.php" target="_blank"><em>Dungeon Siege III</em></a>, entitled <em>Treasures of the Sun</em>.  With this new content comes hours of new gameplay, a brand new plot arc, additional quests, and new enemies with tons of phat lootz!

"In <em>DUNGEON SIEGE III: TREASURES OF THE SUN</em>, players will extend their journey and travel beyond the borders of Ehb to an all–new environment: the Aranoi Desert. On their search for a lost Legion hero, players will fight through hordes of new villains only to find a forgotten abbey hiding a long–lost secret: the greatest treasure of the Azunite faith."

The developers have also improved several refinements to the systems and mechanics of the game including:
<ul>
	<li><strong>New abilities:</strong> Players will be able to attain mastery of the arcane through powerful new attack, defense and healing abilities.</li>
	<li><strong>Level up to 35:</strong> <em>DUNGEON SIEGE III: TREASURES OF THE SUN</em> will further power up players by raising <em>DUNGEON SIEGE III</em>'s existing level cap from 30 to 35.</li>
	<li><strong>More monsters and items:</strong> Players will encounter new monsters in the Aranoi Desert—including mummies and giant skeletons—and will find more powerful items, adding to the thousands already available in <em>DUNGEON SIEGE III</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Reallocate Talent &amp; Proficiency Points:</strong> Players can reallocate points spent in Proficiencies and Talents, enabling changes to character customization throughout the campaign.</li>
	<li><strong>New Enchanting System:</strong> Transmuting items now gives players chances at gaining powerful new Vials that allow them to enhance their weapons and armor through the DLC's new enchanting system.</li>
</ul>
<em>Treasures of the Sun</em> is due out in October, and should retail for $9.99.  Players can download the DLC via Steam, Xbox LIVE and the PlayStation Network.

		<title>Interview with Gavin Dunne of Miracle of Sound</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gaming may have found its proper representative in the world of music!

Recently I had the pleasure of speaking with the talented Gavin Dunne, the man behind Miracle of Sound. For those of you who haven't been brought to eargasm by this man's musical awesomeness, Gavin writes amazing songs about video games. He's doing pretty well on The Escapist at the moment and just got back from an appearance at Gamescom with Bioware to promote his newest song, Normandy.

<strong>Jordan Hedges</strong>: First of all, thanks again for taking the time to do this interview. It means a lot to the folks here at Nightmare Mode.

<strong>Gavin Dunne</strong>: No problem! Sorry it took so long.

<strong>JH</strong>: No worries my friend. Alrighty first question. At Gamescom you got to meet with Bioware's representitives. What was it like to meet the some of the people behind Mass Effect and Dragon Age?

<strong>GD</strong>: It was actually really fun! They're a surprisingly relaxed bunch of guys, very friendly and easy-going. Especially David Silverman. They kind of just went with the craziness happening around them. Plus they were all fans of my songs, so that was a bonus.

<strong>JH</strong>: That must have been a great feeling. I seem to remember some technical difficulties during the interview. Not that I had any problem hearing Wasteland Soul again. (This interview can be watched <a title="here" href="http://www.bioware.com/biowaretv" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<strong>GD</strong>: (Laughs) The poor tech guy was so apologetic to me, I was trying to explain to him that I didn't mind at all, I got two songs promoted instead of one! I'm sure the guys at Bethesda didn't mind either! David Silverman's face after that happened is pure gold. That look of 'sigh'.

<strong>JH</strong>: Yeah, that was classic. Now I'm sure you get this all the time, but what inspired you to begin writing songs about video games?

<strong>GD</strong>: OK, kind of long story! So basically... I've been in bands for over a decade now, and have always been the eternal cliche of the guy who 'almost made it.' I'd had some bad times with record labels and bands in the last few years and was feeling kind of low about my career and the mistakes I had made. So to cheer myself up I decided to write a song about a game character, try to find some fun in music again. 'Gordon Freeman Saved My Life', had been floating around my head for a month or two and I wrote and recorded it in 3 days. I posted it on Youtube and linked it on the Escapist, and next thing I knew it had gotten around 15,000 views in one day. This was crazy to me, as I had spent years struggling and getting less views than that in a year. So I made another, the Ballad Of Clay Carmine, and posted that. Another great reaction. It was then I figured this was a niche waiting to be tapped into! It just feels natural for me to mix my favourite hobby with my music. There's lots of inspiration to be had in games.

<strong>JH</strong>: I agree completely. There's a lot of characters just waiting for songs to be sung of their exploits. I remember catching an article about Commander Shepard and watching your popularity explode from there. How did it feel to watch that happen from your end?

<strong>GD</strong>: That felt amazing. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced. To go from struggling to get ten people to come to my gigs, to having a song go viral like that... I was hopping up and down on my chair with excitement, phoning the girlfreind every ten minutes to let her know how it was going. That was the song that really made the Miracle Of Sound thing explode. I guess Bioware fans are just very passionate! I can understand why the song is popular though. It's very catchy in an immediate, poppy kind of way. It's easy to sing along with. A song like that doesn't come around very often, it's hard to write truly catchy songs. I always thought my songs were good enough for people to sing along to, just had to find the right way of getting people to hear them.

<strong>JH</strong>: I know I immediately fell in love with it. I have an embarassing play count for it on my iTunes.

<strong>GD</strong>: (Laughs) Good! I'm glad to hear that. I get a lot of people telling me it's their favourite song ever - that's a great feeling. Makes me smile.

<strong>JH</strong>: I can imagine. So what would you say is your favorite game/series?

<strong>GD</strong>: It's a toss up between Mass Effect 2 and Fallout 3, those are my two favourite games ever. I also love Half Life 2, COD4, Zelda: A Link To The Past. And more recently, Deus Ex HR is blowing me away.

<strong>JH</strong>: Me too! Is there a chance you'll be writing a song about it?

<strong>GD</strong>: I've already started one! It's going to sound very like the soundtrack in the game.

<strong>JH</strong>: Can't wait to hear it! So tell me more about your recording process. What instruments do you play?

<strong>GD</strong>: Ok, well I usually write the songs one my battered old acoustic guitar, but I imagine the layers and things in my head as I do. My recording process usually starts with programming the drum machine, then I add the guitars and bass, then the vocals. Everything after that is usually 'decoration', unless it's a song like Commader Shepard or Wheatley's Song which are very synth-focused. I used Abteton to program the synths in those two, or sometimes I will play stuff in on my crappy Yamaha 80's keyboard. Vocals are by far the most time consuming part of recording. I do up to 30 vocal tracks in some songs. I multi track and make lots of 4-5 part harmonies. This usually takes a day or two, then the mixing can take anything from a few hours to a few months. The mixing is where the hardest work is - making everything fit together

<strong>JH</strong>: It's very impressive that you pull this off all on your own. Do you work with guest musicians? I think I remember seeing some credited for Sweet L.A.

<strong>GD</strong>: That, so far, was the only time I have used guest musicians. Reason being, I can't play saxophone or jazz piano! I prefer to work alone. But if the song demands it, I'll try and find some awesome musicians to bring it to life. I'm quite a control freak and I like to have everything my way (laughs). Part of the reason it never worked out for me in bands was because of this trait. I believe my way is the best and will not budge. That's not to say i won't listen to criticism. I just like having the final say.

<strong>JH</strong>: Based on the quality of your songs thus far I can't blame you for feeling that way. Do you have a favorite game composer?

<strong>GD</strong>: Hmmm. Well, I absolutely loved Hanz Zimmer's score in MW2. Jack Wall's one in Mass Effect was great too. I don't generally have a favourite composer when it comes to games, just favourite soundtracks!

<strong>JH</strong>: Such as?

<strong>GD</strong>: God Of War! That game's soundtrack is just - chaos, power and rage. I love it. Also, Crysis 2 had a great main theme. And as I said, I adored Modern Warfare 2's soundtrack.

<strong>JH</strong>: We're in agreement on that one. I own the soundtracks to all three God of War games. Would you ever consider writing music for a game's soundtrack?

<strong>GD</strong>: Yeah I would love to! Someone hire me please! Oh, the Assassin's Creed 2 score was amazing too. And Halo 3, LA Noire, Bully... man so many great soundtracks in gaming!

<strong>JH</strong>: Any developers reading this take note! This man wants work! If you had the chance to write music for any game/series, which would it be?

<strong>GD</strong>: Something like Deus Ex. I don't have any musical training and can't read or write musical notation. So something very based in synths and programming would be awesome.

<strong>JH</strong>: What would you say is the most requested game/series to write a song about? By your fans I mean.

<strong>GD</strong>: Hmm, it was fallout before I did Wasteland Soul. A lot of people have asked for an Oblivion song. Oh, I know, TF2. I get a tonne of TF2 requests, but that won't be happening I'm afraid! I never got into TF2 and I would not write about a game I know nothing about - it would be forced and fake and people would see through it. They might be songs about videogames, but they have to come from an honest place. All art does!

<strong>JH</strong>: I can definately agree with that. Glad to hear it! What's the future for Miracle of Sound looking like? Any chance we'd get to see some of your songs live? Any tour plans?

<strong>GD</strong>: No tour plans just yet. I don't have the financial means to do that. I am actually very poor, believe it or not! The future right now is just to try and keep pushing these songs and getting them out to a wider audience. My Youtube channel is partnering with Machinima soon which will be great for my more COD - focused stuff. Oh, and to get my song in Mass Effect 3. I keep nagging poor Bioware on that one!

<strong>JH</strong>: Glad to see things are looking pretty good! I'd love nothing more than Commander Shepard or Normandy coming on the radio while I'm wandering around the Citadel.

<strong>GD</strong>: I'd love that too! There was hints of using it during the end credits. Which would be awesome. Probably have it come in after the main theme or something. Who knows?

<strong>JH</strong>: I know I'm not the only one who'd like to see it! I think that about wraps this up, so thanks again for taking the time to talk to me today Gavin. Anyone who wants to increase the chances of this man's work appearing in Mass Effect 3 should check the links below.

To thank Gavin for taking the time to talk to little old me, I'm giving him shout-outs to his various locations on the internet! Like his Facebooks! Tweet his songs! For goodness sake buy his music if you like it! Help this talented dude out!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Warning:</strong> This review contains some mechanical spoilers but only minimal narrative spoilers.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">If I could travel through time, I'd go back to when I first got interested in <a href="http://www.achrongame.com/site/index.php" target="_blank"><em>Achron</em></a> and kick myself. Then I'd give past-me a stern lecture.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Haven't you learned not to get suckered in by hype?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“But <em>Achron</em> looks so interesting! <em>Achron</em> could be to RTS games what <em>Braid</em> was to puzzle-platformers! Just imagine: real-time strategy that actually emphasizes careful strategization rather than rush tactics and throwing a battalion of tanks against everything!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">Future-me would then shake his head at seeing how naïve he once was. He'd then go on to ask: “But what about the RTS core?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“What about it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Think about buildings. Isn't the ability to capture and sell them useful?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Well, yeah, but that's usually only done when sabotaging or rushing the enemy, right?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Okay, but what about the fact that you can't sell your own buildings?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“What?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“If you want to remove a building, you'll have to force fire on its position to destroy it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“That's kind of weird, but I guess I can live with it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Well, what about the story? What if I told you that there aren't many FMVs and that <em>Achron</em>'s mission briefings contained no animation?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“I guess FMVs can be too expensive to produce for an indie developer like <a href="http://www.achrongame.com/site/hazardous-software.php" target="_blank">Hazardous Software</a>, but what do you mean when you say no animation? You mean like in <em>StarCraft</em>, where the briefings were just a bunch of talking heads overlayed on a mostly static background?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“No, no, the backgrounds for the briefings in <em>Achron</em> are like slideshows. I mean the characters; the character portraits in <em>Achron</em> don't animate.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“So it's one of those games where the story is delivered by text boxes?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Oh, there's plenty of text, but no, there are actually voice overs for the briefings.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Huh.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Hey, you remember <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Yeah?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Remember how the codec conversations had the character portraits move their lips by shifting a few pixels around?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Yep.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“<em>Achron</em> doesn't even do that. You could recreate its conversations by just using cardboard cut-outs and a spotlight.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Wow.”</p>


[caption id="attachment_10114" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Flap some lip pixels for goodness&#039; sake!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_Briefing.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10114 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_Briefing.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">And then past-me would be silent. After thinking for a moment, he would say: “I'm not going to cry about the story. Even the <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> series, one of my favorite RTS franchises, didn't have the greatest stories. For the most part, they just served to show you that you were incrementally advancing towards the main goal of toppling the big bad. It wasn't about the story; I enjoyed the <em>C&amp;C</em> games for the great unit affirmations, the artful units and buildings, the beautiful environments, and the visceral gameplay.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“First off, there are no unit affirmations whatsoever in <em>Achron</em>. None. Zip. Zero.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“It's nice to have those, but I can handle their absence.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">Undeterred, future-me would continue: “Secondly, the graphics for units and buildings are serviceable, but the overuse of your team’s color can make it hard to distinguish units apart from just a glance. This is no <em>Red Alert 2</em>, where units looked and sounded distinctly different, and you’ll need to memorize shapes and silhouettes in <em>Achron</em> in order to tell what’s what. Thirdly, the environments are okay, but not great. They're comprised almost exclusively of rocks, dirt, snow, and deserted metal buildings. This, combined with a lack of contextualization for the interstitial texts, just doesn't establish a sense of a world existing outside the bounds of the battlefield, irrespective of how much the tangential information and backstory might try to inject life and history into this universe.”</p>


[caption id="attachment_10115" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Hope you like green text!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_GreenText.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10115 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_GreenText.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">At this point, past-me would start becoming seriously concerned and distraught. He’d then tentatively ask: “Is there anything that’s good about the game? I mean, they can’t polish a complete turd to seem as good as it did in the trailers and previews, can they?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">Future-me would then try to cheer him up. “Hey, it's not all bad. At least the gameplay has some highlights! The main thing is that, while the time travel ideas <a href="http://www.achrongame.com/site/faq.php#c" target="_blank">might initially seem complex</a>, the mechanics are actually quite easy to learn and integrate into your strategies. The absolutely excellent timeline, a user interface feature that summarizes past, present, and future events in the form of colored bar graphs, facilitates the learning process wonderfully. By just following the tutorials found in the first campaign of <em>Achron</em>, you'll find that this feature is very simple to use and understand. You'll be reading the metaphorical digital rain and treating the timeline as just another UI element in no time flat!”</p>


[caption id="attachment_10116" align="aligncenter" width="578" caption="Pictured: The wonderfully useful and informative timeline."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_Timeline.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10116" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="224" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">Past-me would then be cheery as future-me would excitedly spout on about the gameplay: “The time manipulation allows for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ9_zCPjCJs" target="_blank">a number of great abilities and tweaks to standard RTS gameplay</a>. Let me give examples of a couple of scenarios. Instead of needing to sacrifice a unit in order to scout enemy territory, you could just: order a unit to infiltrate the enemy encampment, skip ahead on the timeline to the part when it actually gets there, take in the information that you see, jump back to the present, and then finally cancel the unit order so that it never fulfills its suicide mission. It’s like having the power of scrying in an RTS! But there are many more implications to having time manipulation in an RTS. One of my favorite implications is the ability to bring in reinforcements from the future. Let’s say that enemy forces are encroaching upon your base and that you don’t have enough defenses to fend them off. In this situation, you can: send what you do have at the moment to tangle up the approaching forces, build more units while enemies whittle down your defenses, and then finally chronoport the whole lot of them into the past to have the invaders meet a much stronger defensive force. Even just chronoporting the forces you already have on hand can effectively double the strength of your battalion in a matter of seconds! <em>Achron</em>’s deep time manipulation capabilities even have a contingency plan for <a href="http://www.achrongame.com/site/achron-and-the-grandfather-paradox.php" target="_blank">the grandfather paradox</a>; the timeline will fluctuate between two possible states before finally choosing one or the other before the event falls off the edge of the timeline.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">The most common use of time travel is going back in time to change events in your favor, but it suffers from a flaw stemming from how <em>Achron</em> was designed. One of the biggest benefits of including time manipulation in games like <em>Braid</em> and <em>Chronotron</em> is that it allowed players to undo, rewind or otherwise make mistakes inconsequential. These abilities were useful in those games because of the way those games were designed, because they often hinged their challenge or difficulty on executing a sequence of actions in a precise manner. It was also because resetting a challenge involved wasting time and effort by returning to one of a finite number of checkpoints or to the beginning of a level. The limitations previous games imposed allowed rewinding to waste less time and effort than simply resetting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify"><em>Achron</em> is similar to those games in that autosaves essentially establish checkpoints every so often, but, like various other RTS games, <em>Achron</em> also allows the player to manually save at any time so long as they have access to the battlefield. Artificially imposed restrictions are what made rewinding and rerecording useful in other games, but since <em>Achron</em> lacks such restrictions, save scumming often ends up being much faster and much more efficient than rewinding in various situations. The renewable resource of Chronoenergy is used to make changes in the past, but large amounts of it are necessary to alter many units’ orders at once or to alter events closer towards the left edge of the timeline. By contrast, if you carefully manage your manual saves, save scumming is far less consequential and time-consuming than trying to repair things in real-time by rewinding and then tediously waiting for periodic time waves to propagate changes forward.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“So even the time travel component has its flaws?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Yeah, but it’s still very well done nonetheless. It’s one of my all-time favorite implementations of time travel in video games, even if it’s surrounded by a lot of sub-par stuff. Think of it as finding a big, gleaming diamond amidst a bin full of dirty coal. Also, I surmise that this issue is completely absent in multiplayer matches since I assume that save scumming is impossible there.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Wait, surmise? Assume?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“I’m not from the distant future, just the near future. Limited Chronoenergy and all that jazz. I’ve only completed about one-fifth of <em>Achron</em>’s campaign offerings so far.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“So is there hope that <em>Achron</em> could get better?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Yeah, the other two factions, aliens known as the Grekim and Vecgir, seem much more interesting than the Terran-like human faction of the first campaign. Won’t know for sure until I try them out though.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Okay. Is there anything else that makes the game special or different from other games in the RTS genre?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“There are a few more nifty things. A commander / hierarchy feature allows the alleviation of micromanagement when utilized. A filter that imitates visual degradation when one manipulates the distant past on the timeline wonderfully hammers home the feeling of going out of the bounds of recorded time. I was pleased to find that blowing up the in-game representation of the time manipulation hardware didn't cause a typical and boring automatic mission failure but instead imposed a strict limitation on your UI from that point forward in time. Buildings known as importers for the human faction were logical as units were teleported in and then assigned jobs rather than materialized out of minerals and thin air like they are in <em>C&amp;C</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, and some other RTS games. Many units don't have crippling overspecialization and often can attack both air and ground units regardless of their role in combat. Plenty of hotkeys exist for various unit and construction commands. And finally, <em>Achron</em> has made me think about the role of player characters quite a bit because it is out of the norm.”</p>


[caption id="attachment_10117" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="In general, the hotkeys are great and easy-to-remember. For instance, if you want to Build a Defensive Turret, you could just select a Mech (a construction unit with offensive capabilities) and hit B then D to have the building placement ready to go."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_Hotkeys.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10117 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Achron_Hotkeys.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Out of the norm how?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Even if player characters in other games have their own goals and motivations, they rarely conflict with the player's. Additionally, player characters tend to be more reactionary and malleable than free-willed. This is not the case with <em>Achron</em>'s player character, as it seems to have motivations independent of yours and is privy to more information than you are. You look through this character's eyes, yet they still feel distinct and separate from you. At times, the player character even takes control away from you in order to perform certain actions, severing the element of interactivity and further making it seem like a separate entity.  All this combines to make it feel as if you were suffering from dissociative identity disorder, and it's a rare but very intriguing character to play because of that.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Sounds like it could still be a worthwhile experience.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“The timeline and time manipulation stuff is phenomenal for sure, but since so many other things just don’t measure to those two excellent aspects, the overall experience feels underwhelming. Considering that the aforementioned issues don't show up in many other games, and <strong>especially</strong> since <em>Achron</em> has been in development for over a decade where much of this could have been learned and ironed out, the various issues grated on me and negatively impacted my enjoyment of the game. I’m going to continue playing <em>Achron</em> for a while to see if later campaign missions or the multiplayer redeems it, but I find it difficult to recommend right now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“So that means the game's at least functional if not necessarily fun, right? I mean, you wouldn't be able to continue if the gameplay was fundamentally broken.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">Future-me would then chuckle before adding: “Well, there’s this one issue with the controls, and it's particularly aggravating due to its relation to a critical component of RTS gameplay. The pathfinding in this game is quite sketchy, and it seems like units try to take the shortest route to the location specified, even if that route is blocked off and doesn't actually lead to successfully navigating to the destination. You just can't trust your units to make it more than a short distance on their own, so micromanagement and manual waypointing is a necessity.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“What? Now you’re just pulling my leg. There’s no way they could screw up something so integral to playing an RTS. I don’t believe you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“See for yourself.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">“Fine! I will!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;text-align: justify">And then future-me would smirk before disappearing as suddenly as he arrived. As past-me would stand there, contemplating whether or not a future version of himself would lie to a past version of himself, one thought would come to override all others: “Damn! I should have asked him next week’s lottery numbers!”</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Having more familiarity with the game, I'd assess Achron as niche through-and-through. The units, buildings, weapons, and story are heavily rooted in sci-fi and don't go out of their way to make themselves understandable to all. Achron is not a game that compromises often. Furthermore, I think the actual gameplay would only appeal to fans of the RTS genre primarily due to most of the effort being put into the innovation in tactics. Games like Generals and Tiberium Wars in the Command &amp; Conquer franchise include fancy graphics, explosions, etc that would probably appeal to more casual RTS players, but I do not think this is the case for Achron. Based off of my experience so far, Achron feels a lot more slow-paced and methodical, almost like a real-time version of Chess (if that analogy makes any sense).]]></wp:comment_content>

Based off of my experience so far, Achron feels a lot more slow-paced and methodical, almost like a real-time version of Chess (if that analogy makes any sense).";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:5:"10118";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:4:"2773";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"82defbc4bb";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"TmZju826rBAAADPkRN0AAABE";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:10:"1941864492";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:63:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:13:"gzip, deflate";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:61:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/achron-impressions-p1-10118/";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:3:"864";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

Remember when you were like that kid up there, so young and fresh and STARING?

Well, we want to talk about that time.  <strong>What was the first game you ever played?</strong>  Alternatively, that you remember playing?  Personally, I remember playing adventure games with my father as a child, him reading the text to me.  I played King's Quest a lot, and other licensed stuff like the Inspector Gadget game (which was, at the time, fantastic).

The first console game I remember playing was Sonic 2, which I got when I first got my Genesis.  I was so utterly terrible at it I couldn't beat the first level's boss, who is, as I'm sure you know, easier than waking up on Christmas.  Of course, I'm much better at games now, but it's always good to remember how bad (or good!) you were as a child compared to now.

So go ahead!  Tell us your stories.  We here, we like stories.  Especially if they are embarrassing ones about you as a kid.  We <em>love</em> those.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can never remember whether my first game was Jet Moto or Rayman way back when both were fairly new games for the PlayStation 1, but I know it was one of those two. I remember not finding Jet Moto that interesting while loving Rayman (which I still hold as a fantastic platforming game to this game). I don't know if it was really that hard or if I just sucked at games due to being so new at them, but I didn't actually complete Rayman until years later. Even then, I could only do it by using a trick to get more continues or just flat out cheating to get extra lives. To this day, I have yet to beat Rayman without any kind of tricks or cheats, but I want to fulfill that goal eventually.

Since that's a rather short and not very interesting story, let me share the little stories of my first games I got for each of the consoles I have.

After the PS1, I got a PS2, but I honestly have no clue what my first games for that were. One of them was probably Jak &amp; Daxter: The Precursor Legacy (since my parents knew I liked Naughty Dog games), but I'm not sure.

After a long stint with just those two Sony consoles (as well as an always inexpensive and underpowered PC) and their respective games, I eventually got an Xbox 360. My first exposure to HD graphics blew me away, and it probably helps that the very first Xbox 360 game I played was BioShock, which had great art deco aesthetics. Unlike most people, I was underwhelmed with BioShock's actual FPS gameplay, which was a rather harsh blow for my initial venture into a new console after years of my previous two consoles. Fortunately, the second game I got was the Orange Box, which I greatly enjoyed through and through, minus the underwhelming experience of Half-Life 2: Episode 1. I recall playing hours and hours of Team Fortress 2 while my complementary Xbox Live trial lasted.

Since I was finally starting to earn my own wages sometime after that, I picked up a PS3 much quicker than the time in between transitioning from PS2 to Xbox 360. My first game for that (which was probably part of a bundle) was LittleBIGPlanet, which I quite enjoyed despite its quirks. The second was inFAMOUS, which was also quite good. The PlayStation 3 has the virtue of being the only game-playing device that I own where both of the first two games I got were good. Every other system had one good and one bad or mediocre choice.

I can't remember whether it was after the Xbox 360 or the PS3 purchase, but I bought a Wii sometime around then. Besides whatever mini-games were bundled with it, the only game I really have for it is Rayman: Raving Rabbids. I fall into that stereotypical "almost never uses their  Wii" category, but it's not due to a lack of games I'm interested in. I suppose I just always got distracted by some Xbox 360 or PS3 game I wanted to play before getting another for the Wii.

My most recent (but still some time ago) system purchase was a DS. Not one of those 3DS things, just a regular old DS handheld. My first game for it was not actually a DS game but rather the GBA game known as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. For reasons unrelated to the game's quality (which I thought was pretty good), I contemplated completely quitting the hobby of playing games because of FFTA. As you could probably guess from my work here on NMM, I didn't carry on that idea forever. My second game was actually a DS game, and it was known as Okamiden. I have yet to progress more than a few hours into that game, but I consider it one of the most disappointing gaming experiences I've had since I adored Okami but not Okamiden. It's definitely something I intend on writing about if and when I actually force myself to finish Okamiden.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bill Kunkel died of a heart attack on September 4th, at the age of 61 

Before founding game journalism with the creation of the first dedicated gaming magazine, <i>Electronic Games</i>, he wrote a bit for Marvel and DC and wrote a video game column, called <i>Arcade Alley</i>, in <i>Video</i> magazine in 1979.

Founded in 1981, <i>Electronic Games</i> was the first dedicated gaming magazine that took games seriously, and was the first to take games seriously on both technical and artistic merits. Many terms/words like "play mechanics, screenshot, and easter egg" can be attributed to him and his publication. On top of essentially founding game journalism, he was also an accomplished game designer and consultant.

From 1981 to as recently as 2003 or so, Kunkel's work was some of the only serious discussion and commentary on many issues facing the games industry. Or to put it another way, he was talking about calculus while everyone else was still learning how to multiply. 

More recently, he published a book in 2005 titled <i>Confessions of a Game Doctor</i>, and was a regular contributor to <a href="http://www.j2games.com/">J2Games.com</a>.

The industry has lost one of its best, and he will be sorely missed.

<strong>CRIMSON: STEAM PIRATES</strong> is a videogame developed by <strong>Harebrained Schemes</strong>, published by Bungie Aerospace Corporation for the <strong>iPad</strong>. It was directed by<strong> JORDAN WEISMAN</strong>, <strong>MITCH GITELMAN</strong> and <strong>ALJERNON BOLDEN</strong>.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Cover.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-10162 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Cover.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<em>Crimson: Steam Pirate</em> is, basically, golf.
Well, with two - and sometimes three - golf balls.

And the golf balls automatically shoot the adversary's golf balls when they are near one another.
<p style="text-align: justify">And instead of a hitting a golf hole, you have to plunder treasure chests, explode volcanos, rampage through fortresses and board other shi- er, golf balls. Then you aim at your next hole and hope to finish the course under par.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10165 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-3.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="415" /></a>You see, the funny thing about <em>Steam Pirates</em>, is that its gameplay could be masked as anything. No, really. Anything. Turn-based <em>Mario Kart</em> game? Sure, why not? Turn-based <em>DOOM</em>? I suppose. Turn-based <em>Ikaruga</em>? Hm... I might have to get back to you on that one. Generally, however, as long as a game features something that moves and fires, as well as something to be reached and fired at, <em>Crimson: Steam Pirate</em>'s gameplay would fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But that's the thing, right? Games for iPads should be simple. Simple enough so that you can play them in small bursts and still feel rewarded. In other words, gulp gameplay. Gulp gameplay is tomorrow's FPS. It worked for <em>Tetris</em>, <em>Picross 3D</em>, <em>Elite Beat Agents</em> and <em>Angry Birds</em> - and it works here as well. Here, the reward is the story. There are points for completing missions as well, but who cares about those?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>C<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10163" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>rimson: Steam Pirates</em> is <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/todays-episode-is-brought-to-you-by-9963/">episodic</a> in nature. It tells the "Tales of Chapter Blood" and you can play the 8 stages of Chapter 1 for free, after which you can buy Chapter 2 for US$1.99 - which I did, by the way. This implies that either the game is <span style="color: #003366"><strong>good</strong></span>, that I'm lying or than I am an idiot. I probably am an idiot regardless, so please carry on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You see, the story of <em>Steam Pirates</em> is as lunatic as it comes. Mark Twain is a character; Nikola Tesla is another; and the Confederates have just invaded Cuba. 1888 surely was an eventful year. You follow the story of Thomas Blood - no relationship with Errol Flynn's Captain Blood, but sure enough the game includes a few references here and there - an Irish prisoner turned pirate who is filled with glee at the idea of breaking havoc. Kind of like a Bizarro Robin Hood, another Errol Flynn character, by the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10164 alignleft" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The story mainly plays out before and after each stage. After you are briefed of "The Plan", the gamey bits start, during which you control Blood's ships, which have no personality whatsoever. Like golf balls, you prepare your swing by setting their trajectories and choosing some kind of bonus for each ship - "repair ship", "move farther", "shoot faster", etc - and let them fly. The universe of <em>Crimson</em> more than makes up for that lack of personality though. Instead of commanding my brigade, for example, I spend my time clicking on every other ship or fort in the map just to read the bios of these steampunk pirates. They are illustrated by pictures of real actors in costumes, which I found very appealing for some reason. Instead of starting a playing session, I visit the game's website to learn more about its lore. It's not so much that it is particularly deep as it is surprisingly amusing.<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10167" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-5.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I might have spent US$1,99 just for that: to see the still frames of Captain Blood in action while reading the short paragraphs about his tales: how he met Julius Verne or how he had lost a bet and had to invade a French fort for a fancy dress. It's all so bananas it's as if it was written by a five-year-old. An awesome five-year-old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10168" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crimson-6-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Crimson</em> is the portrayal of pirates we long needed in our portable devices: a romantic, cheerful one. Too long has <em>Sid Meier's Pirates!</em> reigned as a reference for portable piracy. While <em>Sid Meier's Pirates!</em> focuses on the menial, drudgery aspects of being a pirate - the long travels in empty seas, the saloon visiting routine, the daily grind of swashbuckling and treasure hunting (wait, what...?) - <em>Crimson</em> doesn't have time for any of that. It drops the open world in favor of a leaner, more focused lark narrative and never looks back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Besides, who cares about dancing with the Governor's daughter when you have a submarine to sail and Crown Jewels to steal?</p>]]></content:encoded>

Normally when someone states a fairly innocuous criticism of a game I like, I'm not really moved to type up a rebuttal online. But to say that Sid Meier's Pirates! is not fun? Of all things- not fun?

You would have had a case with 'repetitive'. (But then what game doesn't become repetitive after playing it dawn til dusk five days straight?)

Or even 'frustrating'. Sailing into the wind for 1/2 the game can be very trying and fighting the last boss too late in the game makes him unbeatable.

To be honest though I'm having trouble coming up with criticism of the game. It was that much unadulterated, no-nonsense FUN.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[All very valid criticisms. It was a veritable pyramid of mini-games and the level of interest wavered depending on your skills in them being evenly matched, or as often happened, far too easy.

It was one of those games were you had to do some self-regulating to stop your character getting too good and beating every ship, captain and dance-off with too much ease. Go too far with the regulating and you end up being unable to finish the game however! 

But crucially, for a solid week I was thoroughly addicted and all the bright, happy colours and buckling swash kept me hooked. In fact, realising I couldn't beat the Marquis Montalban I actually played all the way through all over again and was nicely rewarded with a nifty fencing cutscene. Which made that evaporated week worthwhile!

Stolen PSP is a perfectly valid reason for not finishing a game btw...]]></wp:comment_content>

Possibly the saddest thing modern day Nintendo has done is that they've pared down the number of their franchises they're doing anything with.  We've seen more Mario games than we can imagine, and we've seen some oldies revised into modern incarnations like <em>Kid Icarus</em>, but Nintendo has also completely ignored a large number of excellent franchises in favor of novelties like Wii Music and releasing another game with Mario's face on the front.

We know Mario makes the most money, but is that really all Nintendo has to be about?  They have so many good franchises, abandoned to the ravages of time.  Let's take a look at some of them!

1.<em>F-Zero</em>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Nintendo_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Nintendo_2.jpg" alt="" title="Nintendo_2" width="512" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10176" /></a>

When I was younger, <em>F-Zero</em> was the hottest thing since sliced bread.  Really, <em>F-Zero</em> was the tops.  <em>Mario Kart</em> was good, but <em>F-Zero</em> was faster, it had more attitude, and it was a lot more fun to play.  I like <em>Mario Kart</em> just fine, but I loved <em>F-Zero</em>.  The sense of speed and the focus on quality racing instead of random weapons made it a much more enjoyable single player experience.

It's had a curious history, too.  The original SNES game wasn't fantastic, but the 64 iteration was great.  Following on the heels of that was an expansion for the ill-fated 64DD which would have allowed us to create our own tracks, years before modern games like <em>Modnation Racers </em>would build franchises around that very idea.  <em>F-Zero</em> for the 64DD not being released in North America numbers among my greatest gaming disappointments.

The last game in the series was <em>F-Zero</em> GX for the Gamecube, developed by SEGA of all people.  It was by far the best entry in the series: fast, expansive, and featuring more characters than you could possibly imagine.  The races were visceral, and the game offered a lot of character to go with races you could play for hours.  It's a game I come back to every few months, because of its level of polish and just how damn enjoyable it is.

A modern <em>F-Zero</em> could be done a lot of ways.  It could end up as a Wii or WiiU title, using next generation visuals to impress the player.  It could be a flagship title for the U, with online multiplayer and a large, complicated collection of races; maybe it could even follow fulfill its long forgotten promise and give us a track editor.

The most important thing, though, would be customization.  The coolest, and most unfulfilled, part of <em>F-Zero</em> GX was the ability to make new crafts to race in, to fine tune them with parts you won in races.  It was a really cool idea that unfortunately didn't work out.  The ship building in GX was clunky and rarely produced racers that could compete against the premade ones.  A new <em>F-Zero</em> could take this idea and run with it.  While many would favor parity in a racing game like this, I think it would be fantastic to have a game where I can race my own custom racer against someone else's instead of just picking stock vehicles.  It sounds like fantastic fun, and it's a feature I'd love to see in a new <em>F-Zero</em>.

2.<em>Custom Robo</em>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nintendo_3.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nintendo_3.jpg" alt="" title="nintendo_3" width="427" height="342" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10177" /></a>

There's a number of really cool Nintendo properties that have seen only spotty American releases.  <em>Fire Emblem </em>is obviously the big name (and there are some fears that the newest game won't make it to American shores) but no less memorable was robot build and battler series <em>Custom Robo</em>.  I have fond memories of the time I spent in college with the Gamecube iteration of <em>Custom Robo</em>, one of the few to reach America.

At its core, <em>Custom Robo</em> is a little bit like <em>Pokemon </em>meets <em>Mechwarrior</em>.  You fight missions Mechwarrior style, gather parts, and then build fantastic robots.  What makes it more like <em>Pokemon </em>is how the fighting is structured: if your first robo dies, you bring out the next one on the list to continue the battle.  Building your robots was great, but the combat was exciting and visceral too, with battles against massive ships and against pesky other robots.

Nintendo's last release in the series was <em>Custom Robo</em> <em>Arena </em>for the DS in 2007/2008.  It received good reviews but absolutely no publicity from Nintendo (to the point where I, someone who likes the series, didn't know it existed until about five seconds ago), and it went into the market to die.  We've seen no hide nor hair of it since.

Looking at the franchise, it's easy to see it following the same imagined path as <em>F-Zero</em>.  If Nintendo's looking for franchises that could really position the WiiU as a competitor to the other major games platforms, <em>Custom Robo</em> is the kind of franchise that has the frantic gameplay, action, and graphical potential to really show off a new console.  Take it and make it multiplayer, and we've got one a franchise that could definitely appeal to the west.  I mean, who doesn't like explosions?  Who?  You?  Put your hand down, you like explosions.

Alternatively, it could work wonders on the 3DS, focusing on competitive multiplayer on Nintendo's new handheld.  It could scratch a very similar itch to Pokemon and focus on the collection and building elements, creating a kind of game where you pit your carefully crafted force against an opponents.  Possibly something more appealing to Japan, but with proper marketing it could be a hit over here in the States.

3.<em>Ice Climbers</em>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Nintendo_4.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Nintendo_4.jpg" alt="" title="Nintendo_4" width="450" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10189" /></a>

If you've not played the original <em>Ice Climbers </em>by this point, I do believe you've been consciously avoiding it.  Most recently it's been released on the 3DS as one of the free ambassador games, but it's been pretty much everywhere else since Nana and Popo were included in the two sequels to <em>Super Smash Brothers</em>.

As a game it is an extremely finicky arcade platformer that is in the top half of the recently released 3DS titles only because it is better than Joust-alike <em>Balloon Fight</em>, the abysmal but charming <em>Wrecking Crew</em>, and <em>Yoshi</em>, a game so utterly abysmal that its existence has been declared a crime against humanity by the United Nations; its creators are now on trial for inflicting this game on us not only on the NES but also on the Wii and 3DS.

<em>Ice Climbers </em>isn't as bad as genocide, but it's about as good as <em>Kid Icarus</em>.  And if any “franchise” in Nintendo's stable needs a makeover as much as the soon to be madeover <em>Kid Icarus</em>, it is <em>Ice Climbers</em>.  The less like the original game it is, the better.

I could definitely see <em>Ice Climbers </em>becoming some sort of cooperative puzzle platformer, emphasizing teamwork like <em>Portal 2'</em>s co-op or even (to go way back) like in old arcade games like <em>Bubble Bobble</em>.   It could differ in emphasizing exploring giant, beautiful mountains, or finding treasures located in difficult places that you can only access by working together with your friends.  It could feature exploration much like offbeat Nintendo title Endless Ocean, where you'd explore the ocean without much in the way of antagonist.

That's the kind of stuff Nintendo likes, right?  Working with your friends and E ratings?  And not much sounds like more fun than working with someone to explore a giant, beautiful mountain.  Oh, and running from yetis, who would for some reason try to build bridges.

4.<em>Star Fox</em>

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Nintendo_5.png"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Nintendo_5.png" alt="" title="Nintendo_5" width="512" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10190" /></a>

You don't know what <em>Star Fox </em>is?  You're kidding, right?

No, you have to be.  Sure, the original <em>Star Fox </em>was uglier than the mythical Two Waluigi's, One Cup, and sure, the series pretty much completely imploded after its one good entry (<em>Star Fox 64</em>, or, shall I say, the recently rereleased <em>Star Fox 64</em>), but man was that one good entry fantastic.  <em>Star Fox 64 </em>was perhaps the defining game of my childhood, and I'd love a good and proper sequel.

Okay, Nintendo.  No screwing around.  No plot littered with obscure furry characters.  No goddamn dinosaur people who speak their own bullshit gibberish language but don't have a word for General Scales, their great leader, except in English.  No on-foot segments.

Here's what I want: I want a game where I can fly an Arwing through some straightforward levels, occasionally go into “All-Range Mode!” and Slippy to be a retarded, gender indecisive frog.  Maybe be able to customize my own Arwing—though I might be too into customizing things.  A story that doesn't involve dinosaurs and doesn't get in my way.  Bill.

In short, I want a <em>Star Fox </em>game, not some experimental take or other game shoehorned into the franchise to move more units.  I want a game where I fly an Arwing, blow up enemy ships, and have Peppy telling me to do a barrel roll.  Ideally, it would be as zany and not serious about itself as it could be, because Star Fox isn't the most serious of things.

Most of all, something classic and fun.  It's only worked for every other Nintendo franchise; why couldn't it work for <em>Star Fox</em>?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though DICE's sights are set on making <em>Battlefield 3 </em>the <em>COD</em>-killer EA desperately want it to be, they still have their hearts set on the continuation of another IP, first-person platformer <em>Mirror's Edge</em>.

"The only thing we can talk about and be open about is that we have <em>not</em> killed the franchise, and you can see that within these walls," said the studio's executive producer Patrick Bach in an interview with <a href="http://www.oxm.co.uk/33373/dice-we-definitely-havent-killed-mirrors-edge/" target="_blank">OXM</a>.

"The only thing that we have decided is that whatever we're doing in this office right now, when it comes to that we're not talking about it. The only thing I can say officially is that we definitely haven't killed the franchise. As you noticed, we still love it - we just need to find out how."

So much so, in fact, that the game served as inspiration for <em>Battlefield 3</em>, as Bach explains.

"As you've seen, the movement system in the game is clearly inspired a lot by <em>Mirror's Edge</em>, and some of the team who worked on that are now working on <em>Battlefield 3</em>. People here are still in love with Faith - I wouldn't dare to say anything about the future, but it's not impossible. Far from it.""

The 2008 game was praised for its vivid aesthetic and innovative gameplay, but received a <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/mirrors-edge" target="_blank">slightly lukewarm</a> reception for a less-than-stellar execution. Sequel talk has gone <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-14-report-ea-rejects-mirrors-edge-2-pitch" target="_blank">back</a> and<a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/12/there-may-actually-be-a-mirrors-edge-2/" target="_blank"> forth</a> over the last couple of years, but since Battlefield probably won't receive yearly iterations like <em>Call of Duty</em>, DICE could be free to return to the franchise within a year. Don't expect it to surface anytime soon though: it <a href="http://www.gamingunion.net/news/mirrors-edge-took-7-years-to-make--1115.html" target="_blank">took as long</a> to make as <em>LA Noire.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Warning:</strong> This preview contains detailed mechanical spoilers but only moderate narrative spoilers.</p>


<hr />

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_TitleScreen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10129" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_TitleScreen.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="450" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify">If it wasn't immediately apparent, the aesthetics and gameplay of <em><a href="http://www.locomalito.com/juegos_maldita_castilla.php" target="_blank">Maldita Castilla</a></em> are heavily inspired by <em>Ghosts'n Goblins</em>, an old platformer notorious for its difficulty. My familiarity with <em>GnG</em> is limited to secondhand knowledge and that one rather infamous section of <em>I Wanna Be the Guy</em>, but I'd say that <em>MC</em> aims to be a reimagining of the original arcade cabinet version of Sir Arthur's first quest.</p>


[caption id="attachment_10130" align="aligncenter" width="514" caption="Zombies!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Zombies.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10130" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Zombies.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="450" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">In both games, the player character: is a medieval knight, starts with a throwable sword / lance / knife thing, and fights hellish zombies and demonic red crows among other monsters. There's also the matter of difficulty. In <em>GnG</em>, Sir Arthur could only take a pitiful two hits before dying, and just one hit was sufficient to reduce him to having to do battle in his skivvies. In <em>Maldita Castilla</em>, expy Don Ramiro can take a more forgiving three hits but unfortunately lacks the trademark disintegrating armor. On top of that, <em>MC</em> currently has the benefit of not including those atrocious Red Arremer enemies. Perhaps this explains why user comments on various pages reporting on<em> MC</em> decried the game as “too easy”. Now, I wouldn't classify the game as being brutally difficult, but it's certainly no cakewalk! The omnipresence of enemies and a level timer that's much more stringent than usual, at the very least, makes the game intense if not “difficult”. I'd add that the intensity is underscored by a sense of relentlessness considering that the timer constantly impels progression, and that the ability to pause is completely absent. <em>Maldita Castilla</em> doesn't have time for weaklings who feel the need to pause for a break or interruption; it's all or nothing here!</p>


[caption id="attachment_10131" align="aligncenter" width="514" caption="It may not look like much, but a life-or-death battle takes place here."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Edge.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10131" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Edge.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="450" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Even though it's not officially listed as one of <em>MC</em>'s inspirations, I felt that the demo's gameplay was reminiscent of <em>Castlevania</em>. No, not the style of gameplay implied by the term Metroidvania, I'm talking about old-school <em>Castlevania</em> like the very first installment, where linear progression through <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aip2aIt0ROM#t=5m23s" target="_blank">nightmarish obstacles</a> made for challenging but perpetually fresh and interesting play. The similar sluggish walking and restrained jumping can be easily attributed to wanting to retain the style of platforming that was featured in <em>Ghosts'n Golbins</em>, but weapons like the throwable battleaxes and the boomerang-esque sickles have near-identical counterparts in<em> Castlevania</em>. There are also these blue ghoul enemies that travel in groups, and they generally act like a slower version of the infamous Medusa heads from <em>Castlevania</em>.  And don't forget about the presence of collectible hearty meals that instantly recover chunks of your health!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The enemies up for blood-soaked slaying definitely complement the game's intensity. There's mundane and predictable offerings of the aforementioned zombies and crows, but then there's all sorts of other crazy stuff going on. Headless and limbless maniacs? A huge, fully armored, decapitated knight like Kuarl from <em>House of the Dead 2</em>? Larvae that remind me of the leeches from <em>Splatterhouse</em>? An acid-spewing flying monstrosity hilariously named "Insolent Worm"? What's going on here?</p>


[caption id="attachment_10132" align="aligncenter" width="514" caption="What the hell is this thing and why is it shooting fireballs at me?!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_WTF.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10132" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_WTF.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="450" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The strangeness of the enemies creeped me out, but the entire game's aesthetics put the fear factor into overdrive with haunting music, brooding castle architecture and tactful placement of gore. <em>Maldita Castilla</em>'s blend of gameplay elements is perfect for survival horror, and the game succeeds at being unnerving and scary.</p>


[caption id="attachment_10133" align="aligncenter" width="514" caption="There&#039;s no goofiness here like in GnG or Castlevania; everything is laced with darkness and despair all the time."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Gore.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10133" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Gore.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="450" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">The one and only thing that ruins that carefully crafted atmosphere are the throwable sickles. There's four weapons (all projectile) in the game: the default sword thing, an arcing battleaxe, a set of boleadoras, and boomerang sickles. The sword and battleaxe have their advantages and disadvantages (while the boleadores are terrible for anything that's not one of those Medusa head ghouls), but the sickles verge on being a gamebreaker. They're fast, they go through walls, multiples can be on screen at once, and like all weapons you have an infinite supply of them. Every other factor and scenario in the game puts the pressure on the player and makes things tense, but the sickles lack disadvantages to balance their out their use and kill the tension. If you're familiar with <em>Dead Space 2</em>, just think of how the Hand Cannon completely undermines the horror and sense of vulnerability once you start using it to tear apart everything you come across.</p>


[caption id="attachment_10134" align="aligncenter" width="514" caption="They&#039;ve got a decent range to them as well."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Sickle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10134" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MC_Sickle.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="450" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Other than that one complaint and perhaps some overbearing intensity, <em>Maldita Castilla</em> looks like it could be a great game. The demo is quite short, but it showcases a robust variety of enemies and environments in that time. Quality over quantity seems to be the mantra here. If the full release contains a similar frequency of novelty and balances out the weapons a bit more, it could shape up to be a consistently fantastic and engaging experience.</p>

		<title>Persona 4: Blazblue Edition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IuVCDMKY_oA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A trailer has been released for the new Persona 4 fighting game, and I'm just going to come out and say it: this is Persona 4 characters ported into the Blazblue engine.  And I have absolutely no problem with that.

But look at them.  P4's protagonist looks like a cross between Ragna and that annoying doll character I could never play as.  Yosuke looks to pretty much be Jin.  Chie looks to have some Noel in her, though this might just be because everyone's beating the shit out of her; I used to play Noel, and that was a pretty familiar sight.  As far as cast list, those three and Aigis (apparently "Aegis" in Japanese; who knew?) are confirmed, though all the P4 characters are shown via silhouette which makes them pretty likely.

Oh, and Teddie as El Presidente.  Probably the best thing ever.

Honestly, I don't know about you, but an Aksys P4 fighting game sounds like pretty much the best thing ever.  I'm just hoping that Teddie plays like Arakune and distorts himself so that his physical form rivals the horror that is his personality.  I just want to see him stretch and teleport, and possibly consume people with horrible insect swarms.  And hear Rise tell me to keep my hands off the panda.

Basically, lots of possibilities here.]]></content:encoded>

Here, friends, is an interesting curiosity.

It's called <a href="http://www.nightcircus.co.uk">The Night Circus</a>, and it is a game made by the creators of <a href="http://echobazaar.failbettergames.com/">Echo Bazaar</a>.  At its most basic, most perverse, The Night Circus is a work designed to publicize <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-07-25-erin-morgenstern-night-circus_n.htm">a debut novel by Erin Morgenstern</a>, and as such has the cynical, permanent Twitter and Facebook integration designed to make any hardcore gamer shake their head and cry.

But let's not focus on that.  Let's focus on how lovely it is.  At its heart, The Night Circus is a story about visiting a circus in the late 1800's, not a real circus but one overwhelmed with whimsey, magic, and loveliness.  As games go it's decidedly facebook, but there's writing aplenty here, and it's not something you have to pay active attention to.  I'm certainly paying it no mind in the background, going there for the occasional break and beautiful language.

As an aspiring author myself, though, it's interesting because it makes me think of how things can be sold.  Here is this lovely little game, with nothing to it but its words, and it's both informed me of a soon-to-be-released novel and made me legitimately interested in it.  It's both a brilliant example of viral marketing and also of interdisciplinarity; here they are, selling a book to gamers.  I've seen posts about the game on a couple blogs, and now you're seeing one here.

Books have, traditionally, been marketed to book people.  This makes sense, but it is utterly limiting.  Rather than appeal to the traditional crowd, it seems like Random House (the publisher behind the book) wants to cast a net at gamers.  It's a fascinating marketing strategy, one I think that publishers need to follow in a world where many media are dying.  No one buys books, but if I can play a game that throws me into the novel's world I'm much more likely to give it a go.  It's a brilliant bit of marketing.

It's also a lovely game.  I recommend giving it a go, because it's quite beautiful.  <a href="http://www.nightcircus.co.uk"</a>Here is where you'll find it.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Ugh. This is the future of the internet, one big interconnected marketing tool. My healthy dose of paranoia doesn't help, but the words 'cool new game...sign in with facebook first!' just make me cynical. 

Which is unfortunate if the game/book/eventual film do turn out to be good as I'll be a long time experiencing them after getting off on the wrong foot!

Fair play to the creator manipulating modern media to help her creativity sell/flourish, but every day the internet leans a little more towards the big-brother marketing that will end up turning it into today's film industry.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Seems like it.  First off, the developer is a pretty reputable guy; sure, he does facebook integration, but he's about as indie as they come.

Personally, I signed up with Twitter, and it's 100% up front about when it wants to send a message.  It's Twitter integrated because they want to give you the opportunity to share the really cool stories in the game with your friends (the developer is all about making it so that you can only experience 100% of the story by hearing about it from others, too) and to, additionally, providing free marketing.  But the first part is absolutely fitting with the game, so I don't see the problem with the marketing aspect.

Generally I have a problem with this too, but for once there's a good reason for integration besides just stealing your data (they'll enjoy stealing my reviews of weekly superhero comics!  Hah!), which I find worthwhile.]]></wp:comment_content>

Earlier this week, IGN teamed up with Utah Jazz player, Gordon Hayward, to release a<a href="http://www.ign.com/ipl/videos/2011/09/07/gordon-hayward-makes-his-decision-ign-pro-league"> humorous video</a> that he'd be spending the ongoing NBA lockout as a professional <em>Starcraft 2</em> player in order to promote his appearance and participation at next month's IPL tournament in Atlantic City. The announcement was a fun PR stunt that was humorous in nature, clearly mocking the <a href="http://youtu.be/QCfgCw52Nno">LeBron debacle</a> earlier this year, but various news sources reported it as a legitimate change in professions. No harm done though, right? Unless you're CBS Sports, that is. Then you openly bash the player because of his hobbies and mock the gaming community for believing anything they do requires the smallest modicum of skill. Lets ignore the fact that one, Ben Golliver, is seemingly incapable of spending 5 minutes to fact check his story before posting such slander. Nay, lets instead focus on what he had to say about the idea of this individual playing <em>Starcraft 2</em> professionally:<em>
</em>
<blockquote><span style="color: #999999">"Reeeee-orrrrr. Reeeeee-orrrrrr. Yes, that's the sound of your nerd alert being activated. It is a good thing Hayward waited until after Jerry Sloan retired to announce these plans. For everyone's sake."</span></blockquote>
Classy.

Good thing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Sloan">Jerry Sloan</a> retired earlier this year though, right? Because God forbid one of the greats have to witness such a tragic downfall in the world of professional sports. I mean,<em> c'mon</em>. Gaming? The kid might as well be turning tricks on the corner, amirite? But the fun doesn't end there. When Hayward went on to comment about the similarities between a real sports and virtual ones, it was too much for Mr. Golliver to handle. He fired back:<em>
</em>
<blockquote><span style="color: #999999">"...we have officially reached the point where we know for a 100 percent fact that the NBA is too soft. When a 21-year-old, 207 pound forward doesn't immediately recoil in horror when asked to compare the stress and rigors of the NBA to a freaking science fiction video game we know that the NBA game has been cleaned up too much.  If a Zerg attack really gets his blood pumping as much as a game-winning shot, that's a terrible look. We don't want to live in a world where this can be true, do we?"</span></blockquote>
Ya hear that, pansies? If you can genuinely compare a pathetic little computer game to the likes of basketball, then we are truly in dire straits. Never mind the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress#Compared_with_distress">your body can't physically tell the difference between types of stressful situations</a>, or the fact that winning provides you with the same euphoric boost in happiness provided you place the same importance on what's been won. What is this, Jeopardy!? He doesn't need your damn facts to make his baseless assertions. How dare someone make such comparisons to begin with. He doesn't even want to live in a world where that's possible. But wait! He's not finished yet:<em>
</em>
<blockquote><span style="color: #999999">"I guarantee that no NBA player in the 1990s ever said, 'That karate chop from Ryu was pretty much the same as the haymaker Charles Oakley hit me with last night.' Or, 'Oh man, jumping off that hill in Excite Bike was so exhilarating it reminded me of the time Jeff Van Gundy prevented further chaos by clinging to Alonzo Mourning's leg.' Never happened."</span></blockquote>
Ahhh. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man</a>. The cornerstone of any well reasoned argument. I'm sure Mr. Golliver would have had more to say on the subject, but he probably had more important matters to take care of. Like beating up nerds and giving them swirlies in the bathroom. That'll learn 'em.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had the privilege of interviewing Brian Mitsoda, previously at developers such as Obsidian and Troika, who's working on a new and very promising zombie survival game, named Dead State. We talked mostly about the specifics of the game, but also found time to delve into the subject of the zombie itself and how to effectively convey its horror.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE_COVER.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10325" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE_COVER.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<strong>Could you give us a brief introduction to what Dead State is, and what goals you've set for it? It seems like most new games must include zombies in some form. What seperates yours from the others?</strong>
Dead State is a survival-based RPG that also just happens to have zombies. The zombie apocalypse setting makes the survival aspect more accessible and plays up the horror angle a bit more, while enforcing mechanics like noise (which attracts the attention of the undead) and panic (which affects your allies’ ability to handle combat situations). Unlike a lot of zombie games, we’re not throwing in zombies because they’re popular, but because we want to make a game that accurately represents what people like about the zombie genre – the long-term survival aspect. While we have combat, we’re less about run-and-gun and more about avoiding the undead, managing stress in companions, and trying to build up a shelter for a prolonged defense against threats from zombies and other human survivors

<strong>You have previously worked with acclaimed developers Black Isle, Troika and Obsidian, creators of some of the biggest RPGs in gaming history. What has it been like to go from working with such major studios to founding your own? And what made you initially go indie?</strong>

We went indie to make an RPG that a lot of companies aren’t willing to make: an RPG about normal people in extraordinary circumstances. It’s a bit hard to get funding for any game, but for RPGs, trying to do something risky is almost impossible to sell to publishers. The drawback, of course, is that the funding isn’t going to be even a fraction of mainstream development, but there’s plenty of indie games coming out these days that don’t rely on graphics to sell the product, so people are used to expecting interesting gameplay as a tradeoff for high-budget visuals.

That said, our game looks pretty good and we have some talented artists contributing. We’ve definitely been able to do some characters and plots in the story that I’d never be able to do in a mainstream game, and that’s been a big motivating factor for indie development. We know for a fact at this point that the interest in the game is high, but we’re still hoping this is the first in a long line of unconventional RPGs and games from our studio.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE_LIBRARY.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10327" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE_LIBRARY-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<strong>Like many other RPGs, Dead State has several skills and stats available to the player, but will they be chosen by the player in a more traditional sense (i.e. earning a certain amount of ExP will let you get better at a skill of your liking, or are you going for a more unconventional system? Also, will there be any sort of classes that define which skills the player has, or will the player just be designated "survivor"?</strong>

Our system’s not dissimilar to Bloodlines, really. Instead of leveling up after a set amount of experience and redistributing points right then and there, the player can accumulate skill points by fulfilling objectives and spending them whenever they want. This puts control of when the player gets skill points into their hands – if they really need one to level up a skill, they can try to squeeze in one more objective (collect food, scout a location, complete an upgrade) to get that point immediately.

There aren’t any real classes, but the player won’t be able to max out every skill and stat. Someone who puts points into the survival skill (good for finding wild sources of food and faster travel in the world map) would be considered a great outdoorsman, while someone with high medical skill would be considered a doctor. Higher skill levels cost more points but the rewards are better, so it’s best to specialize in a few skills, but there’s nothing stopping a player from being average at everything.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dead_State.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9098 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dead_State-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="466" /></a></p>
<strong>Dead State takes place in a fictional town in Texas, but how large will the play area be in terms of in-game miles? And how far outside of the city may the player travel?</strong>

I haven’t actually measured the miles in the game, but it’s based on a significant chunk of central Texas. Travel is done from an area map to action areas where the player wanders around with their group looking for resources or fighting over them with other humans. So, it’s not actually like all of that area is built out, but there are a lot of areas to explore. One of the advantages of the real world is that so many buildings like fast food restaurants, supermarkets, strip malls and whatnot use exactly the same layout for each location, so we’re able to reuse a lot of art assets. Players start in the school in Splendid and may travel out from there to different towns, suburbs, main streets, and other types of buildings. As they travel the area map, more and more places will be located for them to explore.

<strong>At the beginning of the game, how will the player be inserted into it? Will there be a backstory for your character leading up to the zombie apocalypse, and if so, will it change from play-through to play-through?</strong>

We’re deliberately being vague about the beginning of the game, but it will make sense as to how you wind up in Splendid. The backstory (friends, family, etc.) for the player is revealed in what they say to other characters and what skills the player chooses in character creation. With a scenario like a zombie apocalypse, most people’s job experience becomes worthless anyhow, and it’s all about using what you know and rising to the challenges of the new world. A lot of things change per playthrough – from allies that you might find or when you find them, interactions with other groups, shortages of necessary supplies. I don’t think most players are going to have the same kind of experience – actually, I’m looking forward to seeing how players react to different decisions and allies in their shelter, especially if they choose to be more of the dictator type of leader.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10326" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="484" /></a></p>
<strong>Will the game feature a mission/quest system that the players can undertake or are the players completely on their own in that matter? Will there be major fixed story events that the player must respond to?</strong>

There are multiple ways of finding objectives – finding and exploring a building, dealing with threats to the shelter, scavenging large quantities of supplies, meeting new allies, etc. Allies are helpful for guiding players to new places, but they aren’t necessarily like traditional quest givers. You may want to help them out in a reasonable amount of time to keep their morale from dropping, but you won’t get skill points from merely doing a quest, as any ally can die at any time. Story events aren’t necessarily going to happen at the same time or at all for every player, as they are based on personal conflicts, ally death, shortages of supplies, and interactions with other groups. There’s a lot of ways each player’s story can branch, even right from the beginning.

<strong>During combat, the players will only be able to issue commands to the NPCs, not take direct control. But how much control can the players assert on the survivors in the Shelter?</strong>

In the shelter, the player can assign their allies to jobs, such as crafting new items or guard duty or even just cleaning up the place. Each job has different results – construction of new rooms for the shelter, morale boosts, food production, etc. The player can also assign wounded allies to the infirmary (if the shelter has one) to heal up faster. In addition, the player can strike up conversations with allies while walking around the shelter. Almost every day the player might have requests from allies, or be pulled into an argument, or may just have to deal with someone who is sick or depressed. Micro-managing your personnel and assets is a big deal in the game.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE_LUNCH.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10328" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DEAD_STATE_LUNCH-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="484" /></a></p>
<strong>You've written the story for the game yourself, so can you elaborate a bit further on how much an influence it will have on the game? And will there be a definitive way for the player to "win" the game?</strong>

It’s not a traditional story, really, and both Annie [VanderMeer Mitsoda] and I created the base concept. A lot of it is creating characters and writing a lot of dialogue to react to their feelings about the player, the morale in the shelter, conflicts with other allies, and reactions to what’s going on in the world.

The player sets off new chains of events. There are areas and people in the world that are going to cause drama within the story, but by no means do we have a strict or linear narrative - though we do have a definite end of the game (and many ways of ending the game early if you fail or piss off too many people). Again, it’s part of the non-traditional storytelling experiments that we wanted to do and could only do in an indie RPG.

<strong>Many games that involve the horror genre use sound and visuals to channel the emotions they wish to instill in the player. What considerations did you make on the audio and the visuals to create that special zombie survival atmosphere?</strong>

Well, our sound and music aren’t quite finished yet, but the goals have been there for a long time. We have a noise mechanic, so actions in the world need to make appropriate levels of noise and zombies and other NPCs will have basic sounds such as screams, groans, etc. We will have atmospheric music used to elevate the tension in important dialogues or beats for combat or zombie appearances. Sound is a big part of horror, so when a zombie appears, we’re going to make sure you get startled with well-timed audio. Unfortunately, due to the amount of dialogue in the game and the game’s budget, there’s no way we could afford full VO – but we will have original music and lots of vicious sounds to make combat that much more brutal. Just watching a zombie eat someone in the game is pretty graphic right now, but we’ll keep tweaking the tearing noises until you’re truly repulsed.

<strong>You've previously stated that Dead State was inspired by<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%2Fnews%2Fview%2F93802-Designing-a-Serious-Zombie-RPG" target="_blank"> your own experiences</a> during Hurricane Andrew, but had you been considering a similar concept for a game before that experience? Or did it not occur to you until after that experience? And just how did zombies become involved in that?</strong>

Hurricane Andrew hit in 1992, so for me at that time, the idea of making videogames for a living was a foreign concept. Still, it’s one of those events you carry with you for the rest of your life and that experience bleeds into the design of a game based on crisis and societal breakdown. The zombies in Dead State are a force of nature – they happened, modern convenience and social support is gone, and the world has coped with the disaster poorly. After the hurricane, Miami was unrecognizable and was in bad shape for weeks and even months after it hit. Roads were blocked, power was out everywhere, food was not being restocked immediately, whole neighborhoods were displaced, and there was widespread looting.

The difference between the world of Dead State and a natural disaster is that the National Guard isn’t coming to help secure the city, no one’s clearing roads and fixing downed power lines, and the zombies aren’t going away. They’re everywhere – it’s a hurricane that sweeps over the entire planet and everyone is too busy trying to deal with it in their backyard to worry about it anywhere else. When you have no idea when or if help is coming – what do you do to survive?

<strong>And finally, any news on when the game will be released?</strong>

As always, it’s done when it's done.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings dear reader! I’ve gotten the privilege of introducing our latest feature, Sequels That Should Have Been. For many differing reasons, be it lack of funding, evil publishers or just a plain failure to see the potential of a game, many games never receive the sequel they deserved. Every Friday for the next many, many weeks, you’ll be able to follow Nightmare Mode’s picks for the sequels they dream about. Kicking the feature off, we start out with Bioware’s flawed gem, Jade Empire.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Jade_Empire_Cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10336" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Jade_Empire_Cover.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="717" /></a>

Jade Empire (2005) is perhaps one of Bioware’s least acclaimed titles, overshadowed by games like Baldur’s Gate, Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. That is not to say that the game wasn’t good, but there were just several nagging features that didn’t live up to the standard expected from such a fabled developer. But then, up until Dragon Age II, Bioware has never truly failed with any of their games. And honestly, even DA II wasn’t all bad. It was just severely flawed. Firstly, though, an introduction for uninitiated.

Jade Empire is both the name of the game and where the game is set. It was heavily inspired by ancient China, taking cues from both history and mythology. In an unconventional move from Bioware, you could only choose a pre-made character with their own unique set of skills, rather than getting to play around in a character creation menu, picking items and skills to your liking. Regardless of whom you chose, you started out as a student at a martial arts academy which, unexpectedly, would soon be burned to the ground by mysterious perpetrators with unknown goals. In the process, your mentor, Master Li, is kidnapped by the very same attackers. And so the player sets out across the Jade Empire to locate your master, punish the perps, and solve the grand mystery, filled with plot twists and humorous characters.

Already in the prologue, though, you will encounter the feature that most definitely kept Jade Empire from ascending to greatness. If you are to enjoy Jade Empire, you'll have to cope with an agonizing, hand-wrenching combat system. It may be because I played the game on the PC, but the combat system felt so stiff and unresponsive that it seemed more like you were moving across invisible hexes on the ground, rather than having a free-flowing combat experience. The combat was based on various martial arts styles, so it would seem natural that it would have at least be somewhat dynamic. Instead, it felt only marginally better than the embarrassing and completely misplaced combat of<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_gxQOOcGVI4" target="_blank"> Dreamfall</a> (from 08:45). Mostly, the combat was something I looked forward to being over with so I could progress in the game, but as usual the game threw dozens of enemies at you at the same time. In addition, the difference on the various difficulty levels was striking. On the easier settings, the combat was a cakewalk that never managed to elicit any excitement, only boredom, while on the higher difficulty levels it led to immediate frustration rather than challenge.

In addition, the game was strikingly similar to Knights of the Old Republic in several aspects. With its binary moral system that pitted The Way of the Open Palm against the Way of the Closed Fist against each other, it became a link between the Dark Path and the Light path of KOTOR and the Renegade/Paragon division in Mass Effect. It began moving towards a moral system that is not strictly black and white in terms of end goals, but rather describes different methods with which the goal can be achieved. They also made the unfortunate decision to include aggravating, sometimes Galaga-like, mini-games, similar to the encounters in KOTOR where the player tediously would have to shoot down some fighters. Thankfully, Jade Empire never forces these mini-games upon you like KOTOR did in one of the main quests, which caused agony. Lastly, in terms of level design Jade Empire and KOTOR also overlapped in some ways. They both featured very narrow pathways to the right destination, leaving little room for detours, but on the other hand often managed to cram a lot of intriguing content together in a very small space. Ultimately, I think Jade Empire just didn't manage to stand out from the other Bioware titles enough. It didn't manage to get independence from KOTOR in the same as Mass Effect did. Mass Effect coincidentally also resembles KOTOR in some regards, but had enough unique features to stand out. Jade Empire didn't just learn from its mentor, but rather emulated it.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jadeempire_combat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10338" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jadeempire_combat.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="337" /></a>

Another point of criticism for Jade Empire stems from its linearity. From the beginning to the end, the player had no choice in how to explore the world, but rather travelled from city to city (well, there’s two in all) which served as quest hubs where the player could pick up new side quests and stock up on new equipment and items. Now, linearity vs. non-linearity is something that never fails to divide the waters, and personally I tend to favor whatever benefits the game. Deus Ex: Human Revolution, for example, benefits from having a linear structure in its approach to the main quest, although this is also helped by the player having multiple approaches to completing them, but most importantly the world in Deus Ex’s 2027 is not explored and understood solely by traveling. Jade Empire, on the other hand, was a massive, sprawling, diverse world that begged to explored, and there was even a<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fgames.thehawkonline.com%2Fjadeempire%2Fmaps%2Fjadeempire.png" target="_blank"> fairly large world map</a> that hinted that one might be able to travel in the world. Sadly, one could not.

At this point you may be wondering why Jade Empire deserves to be have a sequel. After all, so far I've mostly complained about the game. But the beauty of sequels is that you can do away with all the mediocre things, and replace them with improved mechanics. And Jade Empire had a lot of potential. As I’ve already delved into, the setting was where Jade Empire really shone. Far from generic fantasy realms and space epics, Jade Empire took the, for many, unknown Chinese mythology and history and made it into an odd blend of Western game structure and Eastern-inspired setting. There was just something awe-inspiring about walking through the Imperial Palace Gardens that I have never felt in the same way when playing a regular gritty and brooding fantasy RPG. But it felt too small. Imagine, if you will, the scope of Dragon Age: Origins coupled with Jade Empire. A huge world from icy mountains to scorching deserts, taking the player on an epic journey to…well…spectacular things! Similarly, the story was also affected by the change of setting. While it may not go into the annals of history as being the most original or evocative story, it was just plain entertaining. There was mystery! Romance! Terror! And it guided the player through a world of infinite wonder filled with<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fjadeempire.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FRhino_Demon" target="_blank"> Rhino Demons</a> and<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fjadeempire.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FFox_Spirits" target="_blank"> Fox Spirits</a> and other zany creatures. Forget discussion-worthy themes and nuanced storytelling. I want me an adventure!

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JadeEmpire_Demons.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10339" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JadeEmpire_Demons.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="429" /></a>

Is there any hope at all for a sequel? Well, Bioware<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2011-03-14-jade-empire-could-make-a-comeback" target="_blank"> has hint</a>ed that they wanted to make a sequel eventually, but so far nothing substantial has surfaced. However,<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Frafaelbrown" target="_blank"> a LinkedIn profile</a> of a designer currently employed at Id Software discovered i<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2011-04-13-bioware-worked-on-jade-empire-2" target="_blank">n April earlier this ye</a>ar lists “Jade Empire 2” as one his unreleased projects. Seeing as he was employed at Bioware from 2006 to 2007, it is uncertain what happened to the project after he left them. Did it get canned? Is the project still resting on some hard drive at Bioware, yearning to be finished? We might never know.

In essence, Jade Empire 2 would need to be bigger and grander and make its combat less clunky to achieve greatness, and now, six years later with improved technology, those things should be possible. Imagine the combat of Jade Empire 2 being inspired by, say, Batman: Arkham Asylum's combat. It would be glorious. Bioware has become experienced with creating faster paced action with their Mass Effect series, so who could be more competent at creating a fresher combat system. So Bioware, how long must I beg?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would of really loved to see BioWare continue the Jade Empire saga than make this flawed game known as Dragon Age.

Jade Empire just worked. Everything about it was amazing, and it was leaps and bounds ahead of the competition for its time.

I loved it. The story was amazing. It was long. It was deep. And it was a thrilling. I wanted a Jade Empire sequel so bad, then I came to realization there was not going to be a Jade Empire 2. Then they released Dragon Age, and I bought it. I played it. I Got about 2/3rds of the way through it and I said to myself... "Really BioWare? You made THIS instead of Jade Empire 2?"

The game it flawed. It's horrible. It sucks. And it's overrated. They fixed the majority of the flaws, but doing so they created more flaws than the original ever had.

Maybe with Mass Effect coming to an end in 2012 they will start making another Jade Empire. Then again, they'll probably just make another overrated horrible new franchise like Dragon Age.]]></wp:comment_content>

Then again, they'll probably just make another overrated horrible new franchise like Dragon Age.";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:5:"10333";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:1:"0";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"331eeb6907";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"Tm45h826rBQAAFEKcBcAAACA";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:9:"714899518";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:83:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/sequels-that-should-have-been-jade-empire-2-10333/";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1194";s:18:"HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL";s:9:"max-age=0";s:11:"HTTP_ORIGIN";s:24:"http://nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:106:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.220 Safari/535.1";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:17:"gzip,deflate,sdch";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-US,en;q=0.8";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/deliverance-3ds-review-10226/deliverance3ds/" rel="attachment wp-att-10229"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10229" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Deliverance3DS.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="489" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Deliverance</em> is a risky game. Developed by newcomer Southsoft for the 3DS, the game's attention to detail strives to retain much of what made both the novel and 1972 movie American classics. And yet, this same attention to detail will feel misguided to some—primarily, those who play games to have fun. Nevertheless,  those who come into it with the right set of expectations will find <em>Deliverance</em> thought-provoking and powerful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Consider the title a sort of reconnaissance effort on the part of Nintendo, who last E3 promised to bring more mature titles to the Wii U. And honestly, you can't really get more mature than <em>Deliverance</em>: Written by James Dickey in 1970, this is the tale of the modern American male’s emasculation at the hands of suburban contentment. The plot itself revolves around four middle-aged Atlanta men who decide to take a weekend canoeing trip down the Cahulawassee River in the north Georgia wilderness. But after an infamous episode of sexual assault at the hands of two mountain men, the four suburbanites realize that they won't be able to just walk away from this trip...that if one of them doesn't do something, and do something now, all will die. Up steps Ed Gentry, a graphic designer—and the game's primary protagonist—to shed his suburban conditioning and become a hunter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You're probably wondering why I found it necessary to state that Ed is a graphic designer. Well, that's because the game's graphical style seems to reflect this point. <em>Deliverance</em>, you see, is stylistically inconsistent, though the appropriate word in this case might be "conflicted." The opening hour and a half, in which we play out a few character-establishing memories of Ed's recent past (among these, a touching confession of his adoration of trip-mate Lewis, as well as a sexual fantasy concerning a young female model at his work), is aesthetically <em>taut</em>, featuring a heavy reliance on right angles and sharp lighting. This is to be contrasted with the player's gradual ascent into the mountains, which sees those rigid angles of the city life begin to flex. By the time players actually hit the water, the drab colorings of the suburban life will have been swept away entirely in a rush of lavish green and topaz blue. Though the change can be sudden, it never seems unfounded: the style is grounded in Ed's psychology. On the morning of the trip's second day, the player will descend alone into a mountain fog to hunt a deer, a scene that's wispy palette and crosshatched style conveys Ed's transformation powerfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Perhaps most impressive of these choices is a late-game scene in which Ed, the last of the four men not critically wounded (or mortally so, in the case of Drew), scales a sheer cliff side in order to ambush one of the mountain men. The scene—as it does in the novel—makes no bones about comparing Ed's struggle upwards to sex, and this is further driven home by the stylistic choices of the scene: each crag and handhold, shifting slowly into the abstract, seems to be responding to the player's desperate prodding. Enhancing this is the game's not-entirely perfect control scheme, which will leave the player feeling like each stage of the mountain climb is a mini-climax in and of itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And along this line, it becomes apparent fairly early on that "stylus" in the case of <em>Deliverance</em> is actually to mean "phallus"...and when you finally realize it, earlier moments in the game—such as the player's being asked to trace the contours of the young model—suddenly become more potent. A lot of games strive towards "replayability"...<em>Deliverance</em> finds its replayability in continued interpretation. Additionally, much of the interaction the player engages in—from the steady rowing of a paddle, to the careful drawing back of a bow string—feel vaguely, if not overtly, masturbatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One downside of the controls however is that the player is given no options to manually adjust the camera, which is strange in a game that's focus seems so centered upon taking in nature. But the problem is bigger than just that: the game prevents the player from straying too far from Lewis (whose utter bravado the trip's existence was dependent upon) leaving players for much of the game staring not at the beautiful scenery but at Lewis' broad shoulders. Seeing as the majority of the game early on will be spent engaging in overly-simple minigame competitions with Lewis—bow hunting, rowing, masculine posturing, minigames at which the game frequently cheats—and <em>not</em> taking in the sights and sounds, this decision on the part of Southsoft is, to say the least, regrettable.</p>
Ah but though you’ll lose ultimately at those minigames there will come a point when the player will be allowed to act outside of this obsession with Lewis: By the time of Bobby’s sodomy at the hands of the armed mountain men, the gameplay perspective will quickly shift from its focus on Ed-Lewis to Ed exclusively. When the time comes that Ed must takes the role of alpha male (after Lewis breaks his leg during an attempted escape) the player will find their sense of accomplishment gameplay-wise far greater...The scene that comes to mind is one that sees Gentry lying in wait to kill the last of the mountain men, a scene that is accompanied by a profound sense of both dread <em>and</em> fortitude. Player's will find fewer more tense moments than the slow, determined, careful pulling back of the bowstring as they take aim. With no sound to be heard but the creak of the string and the faraway promise of the river, the player's first and only kill is sure to be a memorable one.
<p style="text-align: justify">It is of note that <em>Deliverance</em> is almost completely bereft of music. That said, the sole track in the game—a modern rendition of the folk traditional “Moonshiner,” performed by Cat Power—is put to incredible use. Though the tone of the film itself was far removed from this sort of song, the game, with its focus on the psychology of Ed, benefits greatly from the song's loose and bluesy rhythm. For the rest of the game, however, with the crutch of music nonexistent, the player has only to take in the sounds of nature all around. At times deafeningly complex, at others masterfully subtle, the sound effects fully complement the experience. From the cracking of branches in the moonlit fog, to the inner-ear turmoil of a gunshot ringing out through the mountain cliffs, the world of <em>Deliverance</em> is made real through sound. Especially effective is a moment (during the initial attempted escape) when the player is tossed into the tumultuous rapids...you'll lose your sense of the gameworld in much the same way that Ed loses his sense of the real world; you'll feel the chaos of nature in its most natural state; and surfacing you'll discover that you too have been holding your breath.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ultimately, however, any problems one might have with <em>Deliverance</em> find their crux in the very dilemma that all meaning-minded videogame developers must face: the burden of physicality. Films, music, novels...all three have proven time and time again that no subject—given the right mind—is too taboo, too trivial, or too mundane. All three mediums are champions of the full spectrum of human existence, and in the hands of a capable director/composer/writer, both the stay-at-home mother and the jet-set spy can be made fascinating. But games, however, are in a pickle: in the same way that prose and poetry turn everyday language into art (and film with sights and sounds), games have a still-greater task to overcome—to take the physicality of the world...the <em>being-there</em> and the <em>doing-this</em> of even the most mundane of events, and somehow make them artful and compelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And to that extent, <em>Deliverance</em> is a terrific, if flawed, accomplishment: by striving to convey the physicality of each event, not just the "fun" ones, Southsoft's premiere title generates an ultimately <em>feelable</em> narrative—each stroke, swipe, and jab fuels our interpretation of the characters. Due to this, I suspect that most players will find even the dénouement gripping, even though technically the only thing that happens is that Ed and company return to both civilization and their humdrum lives. Noticeably absent during this epilogue is Cat Power's "Moonshiner," which fades away as the player first encounters other human beings along the Cahulawassee River, never to be heard again. After that, the game quickly reverts back to its stylistic "comfort zone," yet this is not to say that Ed himself has returned <em>psychologically</em> to status quo...the game's final moments—which "simply" sees Ed ruminating upon a lake outside his home a few years later—are as haunting in the game as they are in the novel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Though<em> Deliverance</em> strives to be something it’s not, it strives damn hard, and is worth the time you'll put into it. Gamer's content and discontent alike will have that chance later this month when the game finally releases. Those that accompany Ed Gentry and company on their journey have their own hell of a ride to look forward to.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Being a GameFly subscriber just got a little better. The popular video game rental service is now offering a beta invite that allows members to download content directly to their PC. A GameFly membership currently grants access to a library of over 7,000 titles through their mailing service but the new digital service will allow gamers to bypass delivery times and start playing their favorite games in minutes.

This new GameFly service is the latest example of the phasing out of physical discs towards digital content distribution. <a href="http://npd.com/press/releases/press_110711.html" target="_blank">NPD</a> has reported that the sales of digital video games in conjuncture with used and rental games have totaled $1.85 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2011. When compared to the $2.03 billion sold in physical software, the market for digital content is clearly gaining momentum.

GameFly’s new beta is a free service with any membership plan and can be obtained through requesting a code at their webpage to grant access. The company has not revealed the limit on the number of codes they will be releasing.

The beta will last until its public launch of the application later this year. At this time there is a limited selection of games available for download but the number of titles will gradually increase. Mac users can download the application but will not have access to games until a later date.

Last time Nighmare Mode <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/04/an-interview-with-uber-entertainments-chandana-ekanayake-3672/">had an exchange with Eka</a>, we spoke primarily of the thematic elements in their class-based third person shooter, <em>Monday Night Combat</em>. Yesterday I had the pleasure of speaking with Chandana Ekanayake regarding Uber Entertainment's followup to <em>MNC,</em> <em>Super Monday Night Combat</em>. This time around, we talk a little bit about everything--from the business model, the design and focus, down to the nitty-gritty details surrounding specific classes.

Don't be surprised by anything you read here, either. After all: The Rules Have Changed.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/rules.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10425" title="rules" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/rules.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="106" /></a></p>
<em>Eka and I start talking, and Eka gets pulled away for a moment--he says he'll be right back. When he returns, he tells me about a new character they're designing that is 'going to be sweet.' Naturally, I inquire about the character.</em>

<strong>Eka</strong>
We're talking about a new character. It's going to be sweet!

<strong>Nightmare Mode</strong>
Nice! Of your own design, or have you guys started using user suggestions? I noted that you guys have a forum for that sort of thing, now.

<strong>Eka</strong>
We have a bunch of our own design that we want to get thorugh first. And then we have some "Signature Pros" which are Pros designed in collaboration with other devs which portions of the revenue will go to Child's Play Charity. First one will be with Penny Arcade.

<strong>NM</strong>

Ahh, I didn't know about that. Pretty cool. Actually, I suppose that's a segway to one of the questions I have here...though, before we get to that I just wanted to thank you for your time today, very excited to talk to you!

<strong>Eka</strong>
Yeah, np

<strong>NM</strong>
So, on the note of other developers...you guys have mentioned such 'partnerships' before, and I'm curious: how did that happen, where did that idea come from, and what might we expect or see come from these partnerships?

<strong>Eka</strong>
We love to collaborate and it was an opportunity to work with people we respect and to see what they come up with for SMNC. The idea really came together with a conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Holkins">Jerry Holkins</a>.

<strong>NM</strong>
So you guys have a close relationship with Penny Arcade, then? We got the Assassin costume based on something with them, and Juicebot, too, no?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Yeah, they're local and pretty easy to work with, and we have PAX to thank for our success. It's our favorite convention and we always have a good time doing tournaments and talking to fans. The first PAX East was when we really came out with <em>MNC</em> and this past PAX Prime we announced Super MNC. Next PAX East should be a good one for <em>Super MNC</em>.

<strong>NM</strong>
Oh, Nightmare Mode is actually going to be at that PAX...excellent! You've mentioned before that the Seattle development community is pretty close...I know you probably can't speak too specifically to this, but, does this mean we can expect collaborations to be mostly Seattle game development...?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Some from Seattle, some not. It's a mixture of devs that we're friends with...by the way while we're talking, I'm missing out on a SMNC playtest on a new map. doh! It sounds like they're enjoying it. Typical day, we throw in new content, playtest, adjust, and repeat

<strong>NM</strong>
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Ekanaut/status/112230363555831810">Nerf day, eh? </a>Suppose that brings me to my next question here...we all know that <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22699276/AssaultYoDawg.jpg">the rules have changed</a>, and so we can't necessarily expect what we had in MNC to apply to SMNC. Nonetheless, I'm curious--you guys mentioned that you have taken player input/feedback into account. Players complained about nearly every class and their abilities...how did you decide which abilities to 'nerf', change, etc?

<strong>Eka</strong>
It started with a general philosophy change. Which is lower lethality. Once we did that across the board, more health for players, longer life, longer encounters, skills were adjusted for that playstyle. Also the other big change is level progression from level 1 to level 15 over the course of a single game. That affects player move speed, offense, defense, bot lethality from early game to late game, etc. And the skills went from 4 to 5 skills and up to 4 levels. Some skills didnt work as well with the new gameplay style. Some of the skills from the original six changed To new abilities as well as tweaks to existing ones.

<strong>NM</strong>
So you guys weren't happy with how pro-killer oriented the game had become? You guys want more teamwork, right?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Well the original concept of MNC was what if we took a DOTA like game and made a shooter with it. During that process, we simplified it down to something that we thought shooter players would understand. Now that we've established our style of gameplay, we want to add depth to it. So yeah, lowering the lethality naturally promotes teamwork. It's much harder to lone wolf like <em>MNC</em>. One other feature that promotes more teamplay is the Team Vision, essentially a reverse Fog of War. If one of your teammates sees an opponent, you see that opponent as well, through walls. Like a wall hack. It gives you much better idea of your sourroundings, where your teammates are.

<strong>NM</strong>
Oh wow, that sounds like an interesting ability...is this like 'spotting', something that has to be done manually, or does it do it automatically? And everyone can do this?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Automatically, everyone can do this. There's some of that in <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/check-out-some-super-monday-night-combat-gameplay-10023/">the gameplay video</a>. It works real well.

<strong>NM</strong>
Will have to rewatch the gameplay video! Well, there was a reason for my asking if you guys wanted to foster more team-work--it seems like many of the changes are meant to foster it, or just happen to be a natural 'side effect' of the changes. At the same time, we hear that the way things will work is that only certain classes will be available free of charge on any given week (and these will be rotated). Doesn't this sort of go against the ideal of team-based play? You might not be able to play what your team needs, but rather what the game has available that week.

<strong>Eka</strong>
We want to have at least one of each role available for launch. Right now our focus is to get the gameplay ready for beta, the specifics of rotations we'll experiment with before launch. Cool thing about a service based game is we can try things out and see how the players react to it and adjust accordingly

<strong>NM</strong>
Very true. Let's talk about classes for a little bit! There are at least three new classes for <em>SMNC</em> that are currently announced, with more on the way--are some of these classes classes you didn't get to implement the first time around with <em>MNC</em>?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Nope, they were all new.Combatgirl came about because fans wanted to play as Pitgirl but we still wanted Pitgirl to have her role in the game, so we came up with a clone of her. ur.. I mean the MNC scientists thought that was the best approach. By the way, every new Pro we add (and existing ones) fit into a specific roles. There are five different roles in SMNC

<strong>NM</strong>
I was just about to ask something about that-- We know that the old classes will work and play different, but the introduction of the new classes makes there seem like there is some overlap between some classes--combat girl seems to have a heal/hurt gun, for example. What's going on there?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Combatgirl is a variation on Support and fits that role. Her Heal Pistol can heal multiple teammates and hurt multiple targets. Instead of a single turret, she has up to four Combat Kitties that stick to walls, ceilings or floors. They're weaker but make it up in quantity. Her other abilities include a Turret Fortify that buffs nearby turrets, and a Combat Laser that she shoots out at a given direction.

<strong>NM</strong>
That combat laser looks...well, insane. Like a freaking Super in a fighting game

<strong>Eka</strong>
....so still like a Support but different playstyle. Yep. Veteran is like a Tank. Slow, soaks up lots of damage and can attack mostly at a close to medium range. Instead of Jetgun, he has grapples, a Holo Harpoon Grab that brings opponents into range, and a charge grapple and a grapple throw

<strong>NM</strong>
Yeah, he looks pretty damned neat. And the Gunslinger brings us a third female to the game, too, I was pleasantly surprised! Still asking about the classes here--feel like I'm asking things in a weird order, apologies. But, I'm curious: is the game set in the future? The tank seems to be...older, now. Or is that just the updated engine bringing in more detail to his model?

<strong>Eka</strong>
We redid all the models and I did change the Tank's facial details. He does a look older, it's been a long season for Tank. As far as the fiction, we're still working that out, but timewise it's later than MNC one but not really in the future.I definitly want more female characters in our game and you'll see more variety over time.

<strong>NM</strong>
Maybe he's stressing because Pitgirl is throwing her hat into the ring...dangerous stuff! Heh...as for what you just said--you guys retconning anything in the fiction or was this all a part of the larger 'plan' (as I recall, you've mentioned having a 'bible' before).

<strong>Eka</strong>
We're expanding on themes and new characters won't be just sport related

<strong>NM</strong>
Thankfully the gunslinger proves that minorities have not disappeared in the future!

<strong>Eka</strong>
Not at all. The MNC league wants to bring in interesting personalites from the world. They're all clones so you could see past, present, and ficticious personalities. The three we're working on right now are VERY different from the existing ones

<strong>NM</strong>
Ah, I look forward to seeing what this ends up looking like! So, to backtrack a bit here...let's talk about your business model a bit. On microtransactions--what sort of factors did you have to take into consideration when deciding your pricing scheme? What sort of pricing might we expect on the microtransactions--are we going to have anything that approaches TF2 or EVE pricing for cosmetic items?

<strong>Eka</strong>
We have some ideas on it but not ready to talk about it just yet. Mostly our focus right now is to deliver a compelling player experience, we want the business model to fit the gameplay experience

<strong>NM</strong>
So the gameplay and player experience comes first, it sounds like?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Yep. It's easy to fall into the trap of making decisions based on microtrans and it ends up hurting the gameplay. We've seen it with other titles And we don't know how well certain things work until we get it in the hands of our fans

<strong>NM</strong>
Sounds like you guys are very prepared for a possible evolution of SMNC as time goes on. Super Monday Night Combat seems to be following many of the new business mantras floating around--F2P, games as services, what have you. How did you guys decide those models were right for MNC and how does this mesh with what seems to be the bulk of it's userbase--who are on consoles, which, for the most part do not support these models?

<strong>Eka</strong>
It's very risky for us but the idea of putting content out on a regular basis and treating our game as a service matches really well with out development philosophy. And we think the timing is right too. F2P seems to be more accepted than it was even two years ago when we were developing MNC

<strong>NM</strong>
Unfortunately it seems as if consoles are only barely starting to warm up to the idea, though, say... <em>DUST 514</em> seems to be taking the jump soon on the PS3...

<strong>Eka</strong>
We're hoping the consoles get there. SMNC on consoles would do well we think. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/09/crimson-alliance-yo-dog-we-put-a-real-store-in-your-fake-store-so-you-can-shop-while-you-shop.ars"><em>Crimson Alliance</em> is sort of doing F2p</a>. But I agree with Ben on some of the implementation is not ideal.

<strong>NM</strong>
<em>MNC</em> certainly did--hence why I asked...some players seem to be resenting Uber, even though in some ways, it cannot be helped; the infrastructure isn't really there to move forward with your vision.

<strong>Eka</strong>
Its unfortunate but we need to be in control of our content. Right now the best place to do that is on PC, especially with a competitive multiplayer game like ours with so many moving parts. There are going to be exploits and we need to be able to react to it in a timely basis. And also holidays, we like doing themed holidays. And adding giant chickens. Also Robohobo, who will make an appearance in <em>Super MNC</em>. He's completely rad.

<strong>NM</strong>
Haha! on that note--can we expect any more non-pro characters ala chickey, bullseye?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Yep, you just learned about Robohobo

<strong>NM</strong>
Hah, yeah, hit send right as you responded there. Backtracking a little here: what are your long term plans for keeping players engaged? Do you think that you will be successful in maintaing engagement given <em>MNC</em>'s current PC playerbase?

<strong>Eka</strong>
<em>MNC</em> is a fairly shallow expereince in the long run. Not enough content or metagame to keep most people entertained. We've addressed that with SMNC and will continue to add new content on a fairly regular schedule, wether it be new Pros, customization, maps, game modes, etc

<strong>NM</strong>
Right on. Given the new business model and the focus on making <em>SMNC</em> more of a MOBA game, do you guys consider yourself to be in direct competition with games like <em>LoL</em> and <em>DOTA2</em>?

<strong>Eka</strong>
I'm not sure if we're direct competition given how the player interacts with the world is so different in DOTA vs <em>SMNC</em>. Certain gameplay concepts are similar so we're hoping for some crossover. We're fans of shooters and fans of Action RTS games like DOTA and LOL

<strong>NM</strong>
so, last few questions here...almost done! We saw a volcano in the background of the trailers...will there be any more/new environmental hazards?

<strong>Eka</strong>
We wanted to theme the natural environment with Hotshots and Icemen so one side has a volcano, darker stone, lava and Hotshot totems while the Icemen side have their own totems, ice, water and more green foliage. As far as hazards, nothing new yet

<strong>NM</strong>
Ah, well then. Can we expect more subtle social commentary in <em>SMNC</em>?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Of course. and now we have to do a Yo Dawg variation for Assault. The Rules Have Changed

<strong>NM</strong>
YES! Haha. Is there still a need for government issued food tubes with so much vegetation around?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Oh yes, that vegetation is strickly property of the MNC League, not for public consumption. It's private property. Plus the general population don't really know what to do with natural vegetation. How does that turn into consumable food with proper labeling?

<strong>NM</strong>
Hah! Last question, perhaps the silliest of them all! What in the world does 'From ASHY to CLASSY' mean!?

<strong>Eka</strong>
Oh yeah..I asked the Veteran that but all he say is he doesnt want to talk about it. It was something about being in the service and he was drunk on shore leave. He was young

<strong>NM</strong>
Oh, it's one of THOSE tattoos

<strong>Eka</strong>
He was visibly upset and you don't want to make a man with a belt that big visibily upset. There was sweat and the sweat looked angry

<strong>NM</strong>
I see! Well, Eka, thanks once again for answering our questions. We look forward to seeing where <em>SMNC</em> goes, I know that a good portion of our readerbase are actually really rabid fans.

<strong>Eka</strong>
Yeah no problem, we hope our fans like <em>SMNC</em>. Thanks for asking interesting questions, it makes this fun]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fans of <em>Infamous 2</em> will be pleased to discover that Sucker Punch has released a free update for Cole’s latest adventure. In addition to the storyline campaign, <em>Infamous 2</em> allows Playstation 3 owners the ability to create their own missions or partake in the online community’s generated content. This third update will allow gamers to implement the massive Titan and Devourer bosses into their own UGC. These familiar enemies will add to the scale of battles and provide a fresh take on the extensive mission creation system.

The update will also allow creators the ability to link missions together in the order of their choosing and provide a better system of feedback for the online community to voice their opinions on each experience. Previously players were allowed to rate the missions on a sliding scale but now SuckerPunch has provided a limited text box for gamers to post their comments.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/infamous-2-update-adds-titanic-extras-10361/i2_screenshot_ionic_vortex1/" rel="attachment wp-att-10365"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10365" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/i2_ScreenShot_ionic_vortex1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

While <em>Infamous 2</em> lacks a multiplayer component, the game has developed a formidable online community that has created nearly 80,000 user generated missions.

Rounding out the rest of the changes are the following:

•    Relative Health. You can now change “Health” and “Cole’s Energy” modifiers as percentages.
•    Volume/Monitor Reset. New “Reset When’ option on Volume and Monitor logic objects lets you change how or when they can be reset after being triggered.
•    Author Mission Search. Search results will now display the level author’s name.

		<title>Justin Wong: Training Mode Monster </title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2008, renowned author Malcolm Gladwell sought to discover the keys to success in his novel <em>Outliers</em>. He concluded that the common thread linking the most successful individuals in their respected fields was committing at least 10,000 hours to their craft. Video game champion Justin Wong is a testament to that theory. Recently, he shared some of his trade secrets with the world at <a href="www.eventhubs.com">EventHubs.com</a>.

“When I was growing up, I sat in the arcade (there was no access to these games for consoles at the time) for 5-6 hours every day during my summer vacation and practiced my combos over and over.”

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/justin-wong-training-mode-monster-10378/super-street-fighter-iv-makoto-vs-ibuki-trailer_6-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-10380"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10380" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Super-Street-Fighter-IV-Makoto-vs-Ibuki-Trailer_61-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

Wong has earned a reputation as one of the greatest fighting game champions in the world. The endless hours of fine tuning his abilities paid off in 2009 when he took first place at GameStop's <em>Street Fighter IV</em>  US National Tournament.

“Practicing your combos and executions helps a lot because it builds some type of muscle memory in your fingers so your body can understand when you need to do the combo and when you hit your opponent,” Wong explains. “This also will help you get more consistent wins and even place higher than usual in tournaments.”

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/justin-wong-training-mode-monster-10378/375849-street-fighter-iv-windows-screenshot-training-modes/" rel="attachment wp-att-10381"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10381" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/375849-street-fighter-iv-windows-screenshot-training-modes-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>

Wong focuses his training on performing a wide variety of combos as well as defending against situational attacks. While many fans of<em> Street Fighter IV</em> and <em>Marvel vs Capcom 3</em> turn their noses to the monotony of honing their skills in the training room, <a href="http://jwonggg.com/?page_id=2">it is hard to argue his methods</a>.

“There is nothing wrong in being a training mode monster. It helps you learn the most about your character because you are having hands on experience with your main character and you are helping yourself on knowing how to deal with the match up that you always have problems against. This method also gives you more knowledge to the game and it will help you feel more confident when being in a tournament atmosphere.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The PC exclusive Crysis is often hailed as the most graphically advanced first person shooter ever created. Its open world approach, weapon customization and ever-changing environments are responsible for the sales of over three million units.

[caption id="attachment_10407" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Can it run Crysis?"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/crysis-1-to-appear-on-xbox-live-and-psn-10405/crysis-console-screenshot/" rel="attachment wp-att-10407"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10407" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crysis-Console-Screenshot-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>[/caption]

At the time of its release, gamers needed an extremely powerful computer in order to experience the title and many questioned whether any of the major consoles had the technology to bring the game to their own system. These fears were put to rest as Electronic Arts has announced that Crysis will be available to anyone with a PS3 or XBOX 360.

In addition to the original game, the new release of Crysis is promised to include "an updated gameplay experience with optimized Nanosuit controls, refined combat, and full stereoscopic 3D support."

EA is bringing the experience to the console on October 4th through the Playstation Network and XBOX Live. It will be available for $19.99

		<title>EA&#039;s Origin Boasts a Four Million Install Base</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/eas-origin-boasts-a-four-million-install-base-10436/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite Origin's <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/ea-origin-drm-big-brother-in-the-making-9870/">rather nebulous</a> EULA, it appears that quite a few people seem to be more than happy to use it.

According to EA CFO Eric Brown, EA expects this number to rise this holiday season, now that EA's PC games now require Origin to be installed, even if the game is bought at retail.

Brown also says that EA plans to leverage its 130 million-plus registered users and a multitude of digital payments in order to attract other companies to the service. 

Seems that whole EULA kerfuffle didn't do much to dampen people's adoption of Origin. And with <i>Battlefield 3</i> and possibly <i>The Old Republic</i> coming out this year(or possibly early next for TOR), and <i>Mass Effect 3</i> next year, it seems Origin will have decent growth for more than a few months.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone's favorite cel-shaded RPFPS (god we need a better acronym for that) is receiving a sequel sometime next year, and it needs your input. Maybe it would've helped if Gearbox had done the same thing for <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>? Ah well.

The questionnaire, which you can take <a title="Borderlands 2 Survey" href="http://survey.gearboxsoftware.com/index.php?sid=67832&amp;newtest=Y&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">here</a>, asks some of the standard fare questions: what version you played, which platform, solo or with a friend and so on. They also want to know what you like most about weapons, bosses, vehicles and enemies, but for some bizarre reason they're not too interested in your thoughts on the game's story. Hmph.

Gearbox are also looking to improve the sequel's PC interface and performance, so if you have anything to say about that you can head on over to their <a title="Gearbox Forum" href="http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=128237" target="_blank">forum.</a>

		<title>Nintendo 3DS Takes the Art World by Storm</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to Nintendo, photographers will no longer feel pressured to bring their art to life.  From September 1 to September 17, 2011 the Magnum Gallery in Paris will be exhibiting the works of eighty photographers, including such notables as Martin Parr, Thomas Dworzak and Gueorgui Pinkhassov. What sets this exhibit apart is the device used to capture the photos.

The Nintendo 3DS not only plays games, it provides a camera that converts pictures to three dimensions. It boasts a rare technology that allows the user to see the screen in 3D without the need for specialized glasses. Magnum Photos recognized the potential of the technology to create an entirely new artistic experience.

Parr was excited by the possibilities of the 3DS. "It's quite amazing how it comes to life. It makes it so much more interesting." He feels the camera aids the artist by providing the depth needed to make the subject appear more realistic. "That's the potential I see. It can deal with more complicated things and make them interesting and compelling."

<p style="text-align: center"></p>
The 3DS is continuing to ride a wave of good fortune since it dropped its hefty prize tag to $169.99 on August 12th. <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/RuPbS4gH1NTjr4FhTvxC1i6qW3jrIWym">Nintendo</a> has sold "more than 235,000 Nintendo 3DS™ portable entertainment systems in the United States in August, and the system finished as the No. 2 best-selling dedicated game system for the month."

		<title>Battlefield 3&#039;s Campaign Will Depict Intense, Authentic War</title>

<em>Battlefield</em> isn't a series that sells itself on story. Sure, there's a campaign component and there's work put in to it, but it feels like something you play when EA's servers go down. It's engaging enough, but it's got nothing on the multiplayer, and the writing in <em>Bad Company 2</em> provided me enough cringe-worthy moments to disfigure my cheek bones.

David Goldfarb, lead designer and writer of the game's single player campaign, would like to ensure that doesn't happen again, and he's written a blog post to accompany the game's latest <a title="Battlefield 3 Guillotine Teaser" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5eLbPQt_Pk&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">teaser</a> about how<em> Battlefield 3</em> manages to provide that intangible vibe of real, authentic war.

"We loved making<em> Battlefield: Bad Company</em> and <em>Bad Company 2</em>. They were great fun, they had their own theme, they were light hearted. In essence, they were adventure flicks. Indiana Jones with an assault rifle," he writes.

"<em>Battlefield 3</em> goes much closer to contemporary reality and current events than previous games in the series. We’re depicting a war and everything that suggests.

"We're telling a war story now, and that means it needs to feel credible, it needs to feel contemporary, and it needs to connect with things and emotions that we have never really tried or had the means to properly connect to before."

The story unfolds as a frame narrative, played out in a series of recollections from protagonist Staff Sgt. Henry "Black" Blackburn. We won't just be playing as him, though: the narrative jumps from character to character across the globe, from New York to Paris to Tehran.

"Each playable character in <em>Battlefield 3</em> allows the player to obtain his (or her) own perspective of the chaotic events that transpire, giving us the opportunity to explore the human psyche and what it means to be human," he says.

Color me cynical but that's a big promise to make. This medium doesn't have a reputation for tackling the human condition particularly well, let alone in its most popular sub-genre better known for teabagging than narrative and emotional complexity. I have my reservations, but if ever there was a time for DICE's narrative chops to shine, it's now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Any fan of <em>LOST</em> will remember the climactic speech given by Dr. Jack Shepherd as he attempted to unite a diverse group of castaways on a strange and hostile island.</div>
"Every man for himself is not gonna work. It's time to start organizing. We need to figure out how we're gonna survive here. Now I found water... fresh water up in the valley. I'll take a group in at first light. If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute! Last week most of us were strangers. But we're all here now, and God knows how long we're gonna be here. But if we can't, live together... we're gonna die alone."

For most of us, we'll never be put in an extraordinary situation where every decision could mean life or death. However, if you're like me (and let's face it, you probably are, because you're on this website), then you realize that the majority of video games constantly place us in dangerous scenarios. Many of us have been pinned into a corner by a Spartan Laser with only a few needles left in our spiky pink gun, or tried to jump over endless Hadoukens only to get an uppercut if we try to get any closer. Sometimes we escape the situation. Most of the time we get shellacked.

Inevitably we're left with one of three choices:

1) Throw the crummy Mad Catz controller against the wall and fume, before going to GameStop the next day and shelling out ten dollars for a new crummy Mad Catz controller.

2) Work diligently on honing your skills until you become a better player.

3) Go to the internet and look for that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fnightmaremode.net%2Fwp-admin%2Fwww.gamefaqs.com" target="_blank">GameFAQs</a> bookmark so you can find a way to cheat the system.

<div>

In the last several years, something strange happened to the world of gaming. The single player experience became overshadowed by multiplayer experiences that thrust gamers into epic battles with strangers from around the globe. Titles such as <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Modern Warfare</em> provided the individual with an opportunity to take on the world's best by providing a frantic environment where kill count is king.

Online multiplayer was groundbreaking, but it always felt hollow. I assumed that players more talented than myself were thinking, "What an idiot. This guy's blown himself up with his own rocket launcher four times in the last six minutes." On the flip side I felt that lesser players were saying, "This guy's a douche. He probably spends eight hours a night practicing because he's got no life."

We all deserve a pat on the back once in a while for accomplishing something difficult in a game (except for my brother, who constantly substitutes my quarterback for my kicker in <em>Madden</em> while I'm in the bathroom.) Thankfully, video game developers have started to become aware of our plight. In the last couple of years, games have embraced cooperation as the strongest way to dominate a situation. Let's look at three examples:

1) <em>Uncharted 3</em> (Beta)

Taking a page from modes such as Horde (<em>Gears of War</em>) and Firefight (<em>Halo</em>), <em>Uncharted 3</em> added its own cinematic flair and playful banter to a cooperative mode that out-shined the generic Lone Wolf experience. When one of your teammates went down, you were given the opportunity to rescue the individual by staying in close contact and bringing them back to life. If you were being choked from behind by the unfairly sneaky ninjas, your fate was in the hands of your partner coming to your aid (you could also mash the triangle button, which does absolutely nothing). When you realized you had a partner who was going to stick with you and clear the way so you could run the treasure back to the little wooden box, you nodded your head and said, "Thank God I don't have to lug this thing around by myself as I try to knock down fourteen guys with my pistol."

</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/live-together-or-die-alone-10491/uncharted-3-drakes-deception-20110417113714868-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-10498"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10498 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uncharted-3-drakes-deception-20110417113714868-1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>

<div>

2) <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>

My friend Chris doesn't have an XBOX360, but he loves this game so much he bought his own copy, and plays it wherever he can. He's a <em>Left 4 Dead</em> nomad. The first time we played, I ran off into an eerie looking building to look for an upgrade to my frying pan and a Jockey hopped onto my head. I ran around in a circle like a fool until my health ran out. The next time it happened, I made sure to have a teammate close by, and they shot the little guy off my head before he could lay a scratch on me. The moral of this story? Watch your friend's back (also stop letting the Jockey jump on you like the facehugger from Alien).

</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/live-together-or-die-alone-10491/screenshot02/" rel="attachment wp-att-10499"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10499 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screenshot02-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>

<div>

3) <em>Portal 2</em>

Valve created the ultimate teamwork experience in their latest title. If you're a gamer that doesn't work well with others, you won't escape the first chamber. As the levels progress, the satisfaction that you and your partner achieve through solving seemingly impossible challenges makes you want to call <strong>Anteater21</strong> on the phone and celebrate your brilliance.

</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/live-together-or-die-alone-10491/portal2co-op-3-590x331/" rel="attachment wp-att-10500"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10500 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Portal2co-op-3-590x331-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>

<div>

These examples are just a taste of a new era. Game creators had the choice to construct a system where players start off in the same location, but could leave the group and finish the job on their own. Instead, they've provided challenges that are so demanding that only the most sadistic players would venture away from their teammates.

</div>
<div>The one constant in gaming is that we'll always find ourselves in situations in which we are outmatched. The good news is we now have a fourth option. We can overcome our shortcomings by watching our partner's back. If we draw our gun too late and lie bleeding in the dirt, we can holler into our headset and ask a friend for a medpack. Our fourth option is <em>each other. </em>

</div>
<div>Cooperation is not only a tool for developers to create more engaging challenges, but it creates a sense of satisfaction that single player achievements can't match. When you feel like you're part of something bigger than yourself, the victory holds a great deal of substance and meaning.

</div>
<div>This week, <em>Halo: Reach </em>was the most played game on Xbox Live. Every free-for-all match can be thought of as a dozen starving children fighting over the last dinner roll. When it's all over and you see your name on top of the list at the end of the match, you ignore the grumbling voices over your headset, and enjoy your moment in the sun. You eat that roll and pound your chest, and ignore the hateful eyes watching you walk away from the table.

</div>
<div>Let's take that same game and look at team deathmatch. Instead of camping in the corner of the map with a sniper gun waiting for novice players to wander into the open, you're flanking a squad of enemy Spartans in a speeding warthog with two other passengers. Instead of lurking in the shadows and keeping an eye on the weakest player for another easy kill, you're coordinating a simultaneous attack on every doorway of an enemy building. Whenever you're part of something bigger than yourself, you're grabbing that same dinner roll and ripping off a piece for every smiling face at the table.</div>
<div>

Developers are recognizing our gravitation toward cooperation in the local and online community and nudging us closer to helping our digital partners. It's the next step in the evolution of the industry, because it not only provides a more satisfying experience, but it creates a stronger community that will stay loyal to their product. When it comes to video games, working together is always better than dying alone.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Consider two hypothetical RPGs. The first follows the adventures of a young man with an inexplicable talent for convincing people to follow him around in single-file. The hero himself is a pre-rendered character, coming complete with gender, name, appearance, backstory, skills, accessories, kung-fu grip, etc, to the point where the player’s role in the story is limited to indicating which onion monster should die first, usually going by which one happens to look at him funny. The hero and his friends travel around the world trying to find the man who burned down the hero’s home village. He goes to the Imperial city, where he follows a lead to TheMerchantCity, where he takes a ship to ThePortCity, and then heads to TheMountainCity to rescue some guy. This bumbling path eventually leads to the Evil Overlord, who burns villages on a regular basis because he gets cold easily. He’s also the hero’s brother. The overlord is summarily killed; cue the J-Pop and the credits.

Our other hypothetical game, however, has a much more liberal approach to characterization and story. The player can decide who their hero is, up to and including “An amorphous blob of flesh”. Once the player has created his blob, he’s given a quick endgame goal and booted out into the game to do whatever he wants, because a blob might not be keen on following most typical plot points. Many optional side-quests occur, not many of which relate to each other within the game. The hero winds up meeting the Evil Overlord by accident, who turns out to be just some guy. He dies; end game.

The key difference between these two games is that the first had the main character’s personality in mind before the title screen. That design decision leads to diverging schools of thought in story structure and gameplay.

The “established hero” option has a few advantages in terms of story. A story that has pre-established the personality of the protagonist can have a character arc over the course of the story, which is logistically impossible for a game that tries to plan for every possible personality. A story can’t have a sociopathic hero gradually gain the capacity to feel pity if the player has already designed him to be Mr. Rogers. This conundrum can extend to plot-related events too: if the only way to get into the Evil Overlord’s Absurdly Tall Tower is to become grand champion of the Overlord’s annual hitting-each-other-with-pointy-objects tournament, the Mr. Rogers character would probably experience more than a bit of hesitation. By treating the protagonist like any other character in the story, an RPG can plot out the story with whatever twists it feels like without worrying about the guy on the other side of the screen.

This applies to gameplay as well as story. If the main character is established as a fighter, instead of letting the player choose between the holy triumvirate of fighter/mage/thief that has dominated RPGs ever since Gary Gygax decided that strategy games weren’t cutting it, the game can focus on providing interesting challenges for the warrior without worrying that the mage and thief might cry and go home because they weren’t getting any attention.

However, the “amorphous blob” approach has its own advantages, chief among them being that beloved buzzword of the RPG community, immersion. While an established character can have a stronger personality than a player created one, he’s still just that- an established character. He’s a known factor, without any blanks for the player to fill in for himself. The established hero is always going to make the same choices; the amorphous blob, in theory, can make whatever choice that the player thinks the blob should. In practice, no game has offered total freedom in choice, most instead going by the second great triumvirate of the RPG community, “idealistic/balanced/pragmatic”, usually simplified as “good/neutral/evil” (and usually demonstrated as “I’ll do whatever you ask/I’ll do it for a comically small sum of money/Tell me the names of all of your relatives so I may kill them too”). But even this typical choice can have a great impact if handled well and presented with variety: a “good” opinion on one thing, a “neutral” on another, etc. Your character can make the exact same decisions you would, or it could have an entirely foreign personality, but the constant shaping of that character can be a much more immersive experience than watching an established hero make his own decisions.

And, as with established characters, an amorphous blob’s advantages in the story department carry over to gameplay. Since the player is supposed to come up with their own backstory (which, oddly enough, never seems to involve leveling up before the game has started), the player is usually required to decide what abilities their character has. It can be as simple as picking a class, or it can be as complex as deciding which out of a variety of skills their character will use. If it’s the latter, some of these skills will need to go hand in hand for a successful character- just try and use a Pickpocketing skill without a Sneaking skill, I dare you- but they otherwise can be mixed however the player likes for their preferred playstyle.

The amorphous blob and the established character are just two extremes on a sliding scale, though. Recent WRPGs seem to be taking a middle ground approach: pre-determining parts of the character, but leaving others for the player to blob up on his own. The “Good/Neutral/Evil” triumvirate typically comes into play with renewed strength here: the character’s backstory is solid enough to establish that he wants to rescue one of his friends, and it’s also solid enough to establish that he’s not insane enough to do it by storming the Absurdly Tall Tower dressed as a roast ham, but that still leaves a lot of leeway for things like method and morality. Do you gas the lower levels of the tower, endangering the baby kittens that the overlord inexplicably lets his troops keep, or do you just prepare for a heavier fight? Do you find the right angle to go in guns blazing, sneak in the back door, or try to pass yourself off as an anachronistic Pizza delivery man?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Street Fighter X Tekken Character Leak</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A video featuring the comical Rufus has surfaced on the website <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/news/201109/12050074.html">Famitsu</a>, all but guaranteeing him a coveted spot on the Street Fighter X Tekken roster. Although Capcom has not yet officially announced him as a playable character, the leak looks extremely reliable. The last few seconds of the video hints towards Marshall Law making an appearance as well.

http://youtu.be/aVe-em3241k

It is assumed that Capcom will be revealing more information on Street Fighter X Tekken during the <a href="http://expo.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2011/en/">Tokyo Game Show</a> later this week. Already confirmed for the crossover are the following fighters:

Raven, Kuma, Ibuki, Hugo, Dhalsim, Poison, Steve, Yoshimitsu, Sagat, Cammie, Chun Li, Abel, Ken, Ryu, Guile, Kazuya, Nina, King, Marduk, Bob, Julia, and Hwoarang.
<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/street-fighter-x-tekken-character-leak-10541/sf-x-tekken-box-art/" rel="attachment wp-att-10558"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10558" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SF-X-Tekken-box-art.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="294" /></a>

Capcom describes Street Fighter vs Tekken as "a 2 vs. 2 tag team-based fighting game where players can freely tag in and out between partners. The game promises to marry the styles of both a 2D and 3D fighting game for a fresh take on the genre! Fans from each series will also be able to play with either Street Fighter's traditional 6 button layout or Tekken's 4 button layout!"

Rufus is just the latest reveal of what promises to be a gigantic roster. The hefty American was introduced to the Capcom universe in 2008's Street Fighter IV as a completely new fighter to the storied series. Street Fighter X Tekken will be released on the PS3, Playstation Vita, and the Xbox 360 in March of 2012.

Here at Nightmare Mode, we've been thinking of <em>Bastion </em>a lot.  Well, okay, I've been thinking of <em>Bastion </em>a lot.  I can't put thoughts in other people's heads.  In any case, it's made me think about endings, and how a good, ten hour game should end.

So, this week's question is: <strong>what's your favorite ending?</strong>  Be sure to label spoilers with some white space, or else we'll all be sad and know the ending to <em>Super Walkaround 3</em>.

If you asked me for my favorite, it would be <em>Persona 3</em>, with <em>Bastion</em> probably placing a strong second.  In general, though, games end poorly, which is why I'm always so happy when a game ends with its best foot forward.

Let's talk about some good endings, then.  What games worked the longest for our hearts?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, I'd liked expand the question into superlative endings in general.

As far as satisfying endings go, I of course concur with the choice of Bastion. Definitely one of the more satisfying ends and third acts of recent video game history. I'd also mention Okami. The ending cutscene itself (and the largely Xen Syndrome laced Ark of Yamato) wasn't that great, but I really like the credits sequence. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp4XLvks8Vs) There's just something very... cohesive about it, and considering that's it's a fairly long game with all the optional stuff considered, the credits sequence is a great summary of a great game.

For sad endings, Klonoa 2 is one of my "favorite" (if that even makes sense). The game is generally very child-friendly and not that dark at all, but I always find the ending (and final melancholic "world" of the game) immensely sad, even to the point where it sometimes makes me be tearful.

For happy endings, I love Eversion. I mentioned this in Discussion #1, but I'll mention it again here. By just changing a very small number of things from the "bad ending" (which was quite creepy), Eversion changes the interpretation and makes it "good ending" kind of silly and cheerful. I don't think I've ever seen another game pull this off in the same way, and that uniqueness is one reason Eversion holds a special place in my mind.

For creepy endings, rather than cite some horror game, I'm going to say LittleBIGPlanet one. See, creepiness is expected in a horror game or a game with dark or depressing themes, but LBP is pretty silly and light-hearted, and that's why I think it's ending is creepy. It's immensely saccharine (certainly out of the regular cuteness of the rest of the game), but there's something about the wild smiles on all the characters' faces as they gather around the globe that really creeps me out in a game that otherwise is almost never tense or scary.

Oddball mention: I Wanna Be the Guy, just because even the ending can prove deadly.

The Assassin's Creed series gets a dishonorable mention. Even though the endings themselves can be quite interesting, I hate how a twist ending or cliffhanger is all but certain for every AC game. The predictability definitely takes away from it, and the cliffhanger is just aggravating considering that the resolution to it won't come until much later when the next game is released. What works for television does not necessarily work for games.]]></wp:comment_content>

From the way to win the final battle to watching all the pictures that were taken show up during the credits, it was all just so well done. And walking Paula home was easily the best part; one last jaunt around the world until it's time to say goodbye. It always takes me so long to finally let her go, even after a dozen playthroughs.
The endings of Personas 3 and 4 are up there as well, along with both Portals.
I'll also say that Harvest Moon 64 had a great "ending". Having your Dad show up and comment on your farm and how well you've done, followed by all your friends showing up for the party. I'll never forget watching my brother only having six people show up for his, then popping in my save and get the whole town. He was soooooo sad.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's almost absurd to think that a first-person game set in a warzone can put you in a powerless, passive role, but <em>Warco </em>seems to do just that. Short for War Correspondent, the first-person indie title from Brisbane-based Defiant Development - an indie development composed of the recently closed Pandemic Studios, responsible for <em>Mercenaries, Destroy All Humans </em>and <em>Star Wars: Battlefront</em> - drops players in the middle of a warzone armed with only a flak jacket and a video camera to document the surrounding carnage. Players can than edit, compile and share their war coverage online, and the devs promise that no two <em>Warco</em> stories will be the same.

Defiant tout the game as a "powerful entry-level training tool for future combat reporters," which is a big call, but it's packed with wonderful potential. The game's release date, platform and publisher still remain a mystery.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those of you that look to video games for a good scare, scientists have determined which Xbox 360 title is the king of scream. Researchers at Vertical Slice, a British usability studio recently determined that <em>Dead Space 2</em> holds the crown as the scariest game on the system, beating out <em>Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5</em> and <em>Condemned</em>.

The study brought three casual gamers together with three hardcore gamers and used biometric feedback and verbal analysis to chart the horror level of each game. Vertical Slice concluded that gore and multiple enemies rarely invoked fear in their participants. The events creating the most scares were "moments devoid of any physical combat; instances in which players <em>anticipate </em>or <em>fear </em>they are about to fight, but do not actually end up doing so."

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/researchers-determine-scariest-xbox-game-10592/dead-space-21/" rel="attachment wp-att-10594"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10594" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dead-space-21-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

The study found that the first encounter with an enemy proved to be the scariest, regardless of the game in question. As the games progressed, the participants generally became more comfortable. Also worth noting was the core gamers seemed to scare less easily than casual gamers.

Gamasutra reports that "Other games, such <em>as Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, FEAR 1 &amp; 2, Dead Space 1, Silent Hill: Homecoming, Alone in the Dark</em> and <em>Mass Effect 2</em> were considered, but ultimately disregarded, for use in this research."

		<title>Phone Story is a Scathing Critique of Apple and Labor Abuse, If Only for a Day</title>

Earlier today, serious game developer Molleindustria's latest title <em>Phone Story </em>arrived on the App Store, but within a few hours it was gone. That might have something to do with the fact that the game is a scathing critique of the life-cycle of a smartphone. Through a series of mini-games players partake in the development of smartphones, while narration informs us that coltan, a mineral used in the production of smartphones, is also a source of conflict and child labor in the Congo. In another mini-game, players are told of the <a title="Foxconn suicides" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/ff_joelinchina/all/1" target="_blank">suicides at Chinese smartphone manufacturer Foxconn</a>, which decided to fit its factories with suicide prevention nets after 11 'jumpers' took their own lives in under a year.

In the <a title="Phone Story rejection notice" href="http://phonestory.org/banned.html" target="_blank">rejection notice</a>, Molleindustra are informed the game violated four points of Apple's code of conduct:

<strong>15.2</strong> Apps that depict violence or abuse of children will be rejected

<strong>16.1</strong> Apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected

<strong>21.1</strong> Apps that include the ability to make donations to recognized charitable organizations must be free

<strong>21.2</strong> The collection of donations must be done via a web site in Safari or an SMS

Molleindustra dispute the latter two claims - there is no in-game donation function, but rather, they pledged to donate all profits - 70%, as per the App Store norm - to anti-labor abuse groups like <a title="Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior" href="http://sacom.hk/" target="_blank">Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior</a>. Regarding the former two criteria, they are contemplating editing the game to "produce a new version of Phone Story that depicts the violence and abuse of children involved in the electronic manufacturing supply chain in a non-crude and non-objectionable way," or, alternatively, releasing it in its current form to the Android market.

Molleindustra, who are perhaps best known for <em>Every Day the Same Dream</em>, are also responsible for a of number radical, anti-corporate titles, including <em>Leaky World</em>, which pertains to the Wikileaks saga, and <em>Free Culture</em>, a critique of copyright law.

Gamasutra's Leigh Alexander spoke to Paolo Pedercini about the unfolding <em>Phone Story </em>saga.

"A lot of tech-aware people heard about the story of the Foxconn suicides or about the issue of electronic waste," he says. "But with <em>Phone Story</em>, we wanted to connect all these aspects and present them in the larger frame of technological consumerism."

Pedercini says the goal of the game wasn't to turn people away from smartphones altogether, but to illuminate the real cost of tech fetishism.

"We don't want people to stop buying smartphones," he notes, "but maybe we can make a little contribution in terms of shifting the perception of technological lust from cool to not-that-cool. This happened before with fur coats, diamonds, cigarettes and SUVs -- I can't see why it can't happen with iPads."

Despite the game's radical intent, Pedercini says they weren't trying to provoke a ban from Apple.

""If you check the guidelines, <em>Phone Story</em> doesn't really violate any rule except for the generic 'excessively objectionable and crude content' and maybe the 'depiction of abuse of children'. Yes, there's dark humor and violence but it's cartoonish and stylized - way more mellow than a lot of other games on the App Store.

"Of course, the goal was to sneak an embarrassingly ugly gnome into Apple's walled garden, but not to provoke the rejection. If it was just a matter of provocation I would have gone way further... I'd be much happier if the game was actually available to everybody, and possibly generating discussions around the issues it clumsily addresses."

What he finds most frustrating, though, is that people's first reaction to the game is one of surprise that it passed Apple's classification process.

"To me, this signals a full acceptance of a regime of censorship, the equivalent, for developers, of what journalists call the 'chilling effect'.

"Of course, Apple has the right; it is the acceptance of Apple view about the cultural status of the 'App'. For them, games and applications are not part of culture like books or music," he continues.

"Try to imagine what kind of reaction iTunes would provoke if they banned all the songs with 'excessive objectionable' content."

<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies...</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>And on the pedestal these words appear:</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>The lone and level sands stretch far away.</em></div>
&nbsp;
<div>
<div>I have tried ignoring this moment, I've tried shifting my focus onto the construction and resources. But the time has come for me to face this head on. Death waits for no man. The Mandala must be destroyed, or it's existence and my work will have had no meaning.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>This Mandala has become the embodiment of my pride, my attachment, and my fears. They hurt as though I were trying to hold fire. My pride and attachment fan the coals and make the tinder, demanding that this be preserved and paraded around for all to see, a monument to what I am worth, while my fears reside within every block. Fear of loss, rejection, and misunderstanding are the sparks igniting my suffering</div>
&nbsp;

</div>
<div>I share this with you all not to boast or to brag but for you to witness. Maybe to even share in the experience and understand.</div>
&nbsp;

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh780e-QplU
<div>
<div>I initially tried to destroy it with fire, but due to the nerf the fire spread all of one block before extinguishing itself. So I resorted to TNT. 24025 blocks of it to be exact. But I must admit, I was surprised what happened when I flipped the switch. The was no gnawing at my soul, no blood curdling shouts of “NO!”. No weight was lifted off of my shoulders, I cracked no smile, no uplifting feeling. I felt utterly indifferent. It was an event that happened and nothing more.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>The sense of indifferent was like watching someone read a book in a library. They are in their world, and I am in mine. I didn't care who they were or what they were reading. They just were. Is this what the monks feel? Is this what happens? Somewhere along the line you come to peace with the situation and just let it go? To separate yourself from something else and learn to exist outside the material world? Is this the peace that Buddha and the Lamas teach?</div>
&nbsp;
<div>In that moment I was no longer suffering. The fire that ate at me no longer hurt. I was able to appreciate the fire for its warmth, light and color. But I was not attached to it. Content to watch and not grasp the flames.</div>
I would like to say I came out of this experience enlightened and with answers to share. But I only have more questions. I don't fully understand what happened, or the emotional change that came out of nowhere, or my shattered expectations. I suppose I have some more searching to do, but I am very intrigued as to what I will find.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gaming sites are fun to read again as news from TGS11 is making it's way to the internet. Naturally it looks like we've got news on one of the biggest (if not <em>the</em> biggest) video game franchises in Japan, <em>Monster Hunter</em>. Nintendo has announced both <em>Monster Hunter Tri 3G</em>(data plan not included) and <em>Monster Hunter 4. </em>The former is a port of the fortunately successful title that was released on the Wii last year with some neat new features including all twelve weapon types and new monsters. It appears to be the flagship game for the 3DS's new "nub" add-on, which is interesting since its Wii counterpart was used to push the improved Wii Classic Controller. The latter is a brand new game. The word currently is that it's in preproduction, but that doesn't mean we didn't get an awesome trailer! The trailer(embedded below) was said to be a "concept video" meaning we can't assume that- did he just <em>jump</em> onto that dragon!? If even 10% of that video reflects what <em>Monster Hunter 4 </em>will be like, I want that game yesterday!

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/soul-calibur-5-new-characters-new-mechanics-new-stages-10668/viola5-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-10732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10732" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Viola51.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a>

Good morning, readers! I bring you news of <em>Soul Calibur 5</em> from this year's Tokyo Game Show. Namco Bandi has revealed a wealth of new information and revealed two new fighters to SC5's roster. First up is newcomer Viola, who SC5 producer, Hisaharu Tago, revealed will play an important role in the game's story and has ties to one of SC5's other newcomers, Z.W.E.I. Her attacks feature a mix up of quick, short ranged attacks with a vicious Freddy Krueger-esque claw, and mid-to-long ranged assault via a magical violet orb of sorts.

The other big addition is returning fighter, Astaroth -- Soul Calibur's resident frankenfighter sporting a snazzy new zombie spartan appearance. From there, we have Patroklos and Pyrrha demonstrating the new Brave Edge and Just Guard mechanics respectively, courtesy of Famitsu. Brave Edge will be the Super to the Critical Edge's Ultra. Each character will have two available and it will consume half the soul gauge. The Just Guard acts much like the classic Guard Impact, only without pushing your opponent back and giving them an opportunity to counter you. A subtle, but noticeable change.

Finally, rounding out the batch of screenshots are a few new shots of Patroklos, the game's story mode, and two new stages: Fuma and Evil Shrine. Enjoy.

		<title>Imaginary Games - Book Review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/imaginary-games-book-review-10714/deliverance3ds-not/" rel="attachment wp-att-10745"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10745" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Deliverance3DS-not.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="489" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong></strong>You were absolutely correct: <em>Deliverance</em> for the 3DS does not exist. People seemed upset by that—only natural, I suppose...nobody likes falseness forced upon them. And yet, might there have been some good in it? Consider this: the people who seemed most offended by <em>Deliverance 3D's</em>—should we say—<em>questionable ontological presence</em> were the same people who, before the title was deemed fake, seemed most excited that such a game <em>could exist at all</em>. It was for this very reason that I had refused to present the review as "parody" in the first place: I wanted people to perceive "fiction" as "truth," just for a moment, so that in the latter's sudden shuddering away they might be all the more determined to make such things exist in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>"If fiction is false, then everything that gives life value is false.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">Coincidentally, this week I've been scheduled to write a review of <em>Imaginary Games</em>, the new book from game designer Chris Bateman, due out November 25th. (And yes, it actually exists this time.) I say "coincidentally" because it is this very subject—the gameable nature of reality—that Bateman's newest work seems most interested in exploring: “Fiction is more than the foundation of art and games," he writes, "...it is essential to maintaining our moral notions [and] deeply connected with our experience of reality." Bateman, who is perhaps best known for the 1999 game <em>Discworld Noir</em>, is no stranger to writing deeply and thoughtfully about games. But while his previous three books focused on the objective <em>here's-some-tactics-to-employ-when-developing-games</em>, with <em>Imaginary Games</em> Chris has opted to tackle the Beast Of Game Design from the outside-in—by revealing the gameness of the actual, the game beyond games.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>"Perhaps the most devastating tragedy in recent centuries was that which condemned both mythology and fiction to become synonyms for falsehood."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">How effective is Bateman's approach? Well, I guess that just depends on what kind of person you are. Bateman divides the world into two types of people, based almost exclusively around one's individual preference for either concrete or abstract language. The first group, those Bateman would refer to as concrete-minded, which is to mean those whose imaginations typically require concrete, real-world detail, will probably pass on this book. They shouldn't, but they will. Why? Because <em>Imaginary Games</em> isn't <em>100 Tips To Making Badass Games</em>. Bateman's written the closest he'll ever get to that kind of book several times over already. No, this book is for that second group of people, the abstract-minded—who Bateman describes as being prototypically <em>D&amp;D</em> fans—and as one of them I can honestly say that you'll find the ideas contained within <em>Imaginary Games</em> both intriguing and revelatory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“However, because there are so many more people for who concrete language-use is more natural, there is always a danger of imposing literal, historical interpretations of stories which by their nature should instead constitute a living mythology.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">According to Bateman, our common perceptions of "reality" and "fiction" can be grounded in another, often-overlooked facet of human experience: <em>make-believe</em>. Central to this task is Kendall Walton’s Make-Believe Theory of Representation, which was conceived of to help understand children at play on a philosophical level, and which Bateman masterfully adapts to videogames. In doing so, he finds himself with an array of fresh and interesting ways to approach the subject of videogames, with results that will appeal to abstract- and concrete-minds alike. And even in those moments when Bateman's focus shifts towards something "bigger" than videogames, his outside-in methodology assures us that, sooner or later, he will return to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>“The world of art seems akin to play undertaken in seriousness, play that has acquired a kind of cultural gravitas and esteem. As M.C. Escher put the matter: 'My art is a game, a very serious game.'”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">Oh but for the hell of it let's give you big panorama...Divided into seven parts, <em>Imaginary Games' </em>gradual progression away from itself has a subtle enough curve to please most everyone: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span> sets the stage, giving newcomer's that broad, sweeping view of game philosophy, before dropping them off into the biology and art of play; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Imagination</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Props</span> explore the similarities between videogames and make-believe, the former concentrating on the nuts and bolts, and the latter diving headfirst into the concepts of <em>props </em>and<em> dolls</em>—two terms that's distinction serves as one of the highlights of the book; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fictional Worlds</span> sees the videogame focus begin to slip to the back of Bateman's mind, as he begins to collapse our perceptions of the gameworld and the actual world, in favor of applying the "gameness" of both to other subjects; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Participation</span> examines the interrelationship of functional emotions and representational emotions in games as well as other mediums, further twining the gameworld in the actual, and vice versa; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ethics</span> takes this one step further to discuss how the "tension between the values of the player-subject and the values of the player outside of the game create a unique opportunity for ethical reflection," and links the primary component of the moral perspective to <em>stories</em>--which videogames fundamentally are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But it is in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Virtual Worlds</span> that Bateman's real purpose shines through unfettered: By framing art, experience, and videogames in terms of <em>kayfabe</em> (a professional wrestling term for portraying events as "real") Bateman "reveals" the various facets of our lives that are determined by make-believe...History, math, science. Though the terminology of make-believe remains intact, readers will find that the word "videogame" has vanished entirely...In its place we find that <em>all</em> has become a game--truth, fiction, video, experience. If you can name it, it's a game.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A word of caution: Bateman isn't saying, "Reality is fake." Rather, by exposing the "gameness" of the world outside of videogames, Bateman asks that we re-conceptualize the world and games alike; to see that game development isn't just the translation of reality, but the translation of a translation...and so on, and so forth. And though <em>Imaginary Game's</em> purpose is ultimately far greater than videogames, the sting of realization should not be above those only interested in them. There is no doubt in my mind that by collapsing the philosophy of the "dire" inward, art will benefit. And by finding games in the real world and the real world in games, Bateman does just that.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Right, so that's a really good illustration of what I'm talking about - the finger-pointed-like-a-gun thing.

Go do that to a person in a culture or society that has never be exposed to that cultural meme and suddenly your finger-pointing-as-a-gun doesn't mean anything to them. Does it still even *look* like a gun? Our hypothetical civilization might even have knowledge of guns but hasn't ever seen anyone make the gun motion - maybe their "gun" motion is an opening and closing of the hand like the muzzle flash or something - and to them THAT "looks like" and "feel like" a gun. "Pointing your fingers? Why's that look like a gun?" they say until we try and point out some kind of material correspondence with select parts of a gun and it's operation.

We'd like to say that it does still look like a gun, but unless we can say something about an actual quantifiable amount of shape/size/material/colour/noise (see all these material differences we're already ignoring to make this representational claim?) it takes to "look like" a gun with our fingers we're going to already be implicated - we're exposed to this representation already and we can't unsee it! Of *course* pointing fingers looks like a gun to us - because that's what we've seen people do. But just look at all those other criteria by which the finger-gun fails to correspond to a material gun. We've got to do some serious mental abstraction to get there...

Bateman's whole project in Imaginary Games is to escape the "a game is what we point to when we say that is a game" post-hoc description (that usually relies on, surprise, implicit cultural/social expectations), and yet here he is relying on representation that can only do the same thing. WHY does the two fingers pointed look like a gun? "just cuz it looks a bit like and “feels” like one." BAM. Well, to us, yes, but this kind of thing can only ever be post-hoc. You'll never be able to say proscriptively whether that "feel" or "look" will be present or not before it exits or doesn't exist without the above materialist conception of representation. He needs a theory of representation that is more quantifiable for his theory to hold. Otherwise he's just shifted (hidden) the assumptions a level deeper that before...

Now, that's not to say that his approach is not a *good* post-hoc description but the main opening section of the book is about how dissatisfied Bateman is with post-hoc descriptive definitions of 'What is a game?'. He actually persuaded me that this might be a problem, but his answer did not convince me.]]></wp:comment_content>

As for being too quick and easy, I'm not so sure of that: holding your thumb up and your index finger out represents a gun simply because it "looks a bit like" a gun--just try to pull it on a cop or bank teller. We might say that this is because it has become culturally recognized as a threat, and we'd be partially correct. As children, however, we use it for a different reason: because it is the "minimum image" that fits the "psychological lock" of a gun. It isn't an equivalent of a gun (in that it won't fire); it also isn't a picture of a gun (not in any sense but the abstract, which leads us to...); it is a representation of a gun--just cuz it looks a bit like and "feels" like one.

Gombrich likens this phenomenon to "counterfeit coins which make the machine work when dropped in the slot." The reason representations "work" is because our brains are hard-wired to keep energy expenditure to a minimum, and thus exceedingly good at detecting like "shapes" (visual, feelable, auditory) in order to cut down on "noise."

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been reading Bateman's book since I got an advance version in July, and I have been recommending it to people on a pretty regular basis.

I have some serious reservations with his approach which I won't go into the detail of here, except to say that I think the weakness in his argument is a too simplistic conception of 'representation'. There's an anecdote that he uses of a hobby-horse "representing" a (or standing in for an imaginary) horse for a child. It seems to me both too quick and easy to go from "it looks a bit like a horse" to saying "it represents a horse".]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the innovation of consoles and accessories such as the Wii, Playstation Move, and Kinect, the health care industry is utilizing the new active form of gaming into their own procedures.

Researchers have published a study at the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on the effectiveness of video games on the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Patients dealing with the aftermath of strokes often have difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADL's) with customary efficiency.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/stroke-patients-recover-with-video-game-rehabilitation-10809/_48117913__fph4516/" rel="attachment wp-att-10923"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10923" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/48117913__fph4516.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="170" /></a>

The authors found "evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming may be beneficial in improving arm function and ADL function when compared with the same dose of conventional therapy. There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on grip strength or gait speed."

Researchers suggested that more studies must be completed, especially over long periods of time.

		<title>Sequels That Should Have Been: Jedi Academy 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jedi_1.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jedi_1.jpg" alt="" title="jedi_1" width="480" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10865" /></a>

When I was a kid, <em>Star Wars</em> was the coolest thing in the world. I had all the toys. I memorized all the movies. I read the Expanded Universe novels where Luke was a badass and a Tuskan Raider became a lord of the Sith. I even played the absolutely god awful Super Nintendo <em>Star Wars </em>games, you know, the side scrolling ones where you were inside the Sand Crawler, the one where the Jawas had spikes in their homes.

I remember <em>Shadows of the Empire </em>being my first great <em>Star Warsian </em>love in terms of video games. The <em>Jedi Knight </em>series followed, and while I liked Kyle Katarn quite a bit, I never fell in love with those games. They were good, but they didn't quite scratch the itch I wanted scratched.

My favorite part of Star Wars' Expanded Universe was the <em>Young Jedi Knights </em>novels. These books, about Han and Leia's children Jacen and Jaina Solo, were my childhood. Sure, I dropped off long before most of Jaina's <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jaina_Solo" target="_blank">novel length Wookiepedia entry happened</a>*, but Luke's Jedi Temple on Yavin 4 remained the most evocative part of <em>Star Wars </em>lore in my mind.  They were like <em>Harry Potter</em>, but in space and with lightsabers.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jedi_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jedi_2.jpg" alt="" title="jedi_2" width="480" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10866" /></a>

So when <em>Jedi Academy</em>, a game where you played a player created Jedi named Jaden Korr taking place at said temple, was announced, I was ecstatic. Massive lightsaber battles! Dual wielding, and double bladed action! Darth Maul was the shit at the time, so it promised to be the most exciting game of the fall of 2003.

What was surprising, though, was just how good a game it was**. While most previous Star Wars games had focused either on using blasters or on starships, <em>Jedi Academy </em>had a fantastic, satisfying lightsaber combat mechanic.  The previous game in the “series”, <em>Jedi Knight 2</em>, had featured some lightsabering, especially in the famous multiplayer mode, but the single player still persisted in forcing you to use inelegant blasters for much of it.  With a lightsaber, fighting stormtroopers and the like felt right: you were a powerful badass who could deflect lasers and cleave through groups of enemies, but you were hardly immortal. The game made sure not every situation was just a cut and dry firefight: missions were varied, with some forcing you to run from a horrible mutant rancor, another placing you on a planet with a hostile sand worm, and others having you lead attacks against Imperial Remnant installations. There was fantastic variety to the thing.

The best part, though, was the lightsaber combat. Early on you might find one or two enemy Jedi per area, and they were always thrilling, tense boss encounters. By the end of the game, you had the saber skills and force powers to completely and utterly dismantle these enemies, and the game started throwing smart enemies at you, who'd use stealth, crafty combinations of moves, and good old fashioned skill to fight you off.  Alternatively, you could just use force choke and dangle people off of ledges; this was equally effective, and pretty much the most enjoyable thing ever.

I can still imagine some of the saber fights, some of the levels, in my mind, and I last played the game two years ago. That's some powerful stuff. Equally effective was the story, which, admittedly, was the <em>Star Wars </em>master arc (boy finds light side, boy is tempted by the dark side, boy turns to dark side or stays with the light side and beats evil) but with some interesting wrinkles. The game was structured into missions you could choose from inside a larger arc, and this allowed the writers to tell interesting individual stories like of a prison planet designed to trap Jedi, meetings with universe favorites like Chewbacca and Wedge Antilles, and let you explore massive ruined Jedi and Sith temples.  There was variety in the combat, in the storytelling, and in the missions, and this kept the game fresh for it's rather long fifteen hour run time.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jedi_4.gif"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jedi_4.gif" alt="" title="jedi_4" width="480" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10870" /></a>

Why would I want a sequel (which, by the by, would be <em>Dark Forces 4: Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy 2</em>. Let's add another subtitle: <em>Dark Forces 4: Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy 2: I Want to Be the Jedi</em>)? Well, for one thing, we haven't had a good Star Wars game in a long time.  Sure, George Lucas has tried stuffing the whole <em>Force Unleashed </em>thing down our throats, but the first game felt cheaply epic, relying on huge, action-movie moments instead of what made <em>Stars Wars </em>so good, and the second game was kind of a disaster.  The newest <em>Star Wars </em>game, the utterly miserable looking Kinect monstrosity, firstly takes place in the altogether mediocre prequel setting, and second it looks to be an awful game.  <em>Jedi Academy</em>'s biggest strength, in this brave new prequeled world, is that it doesn't have Jar Jar Binks disease: there's not a single reference to the world before the first three movies.  And that's the way I like it.

Really, on one hand, I miss the opportunity to be a Jedi.  On the other, I  feel like they could take the classic multiplayer modes of both <em>Jedi Knight 2 </em>and <em>Academy </em>and make something truly modern and spectacular out of them.  <em>Star Wars </em>multiplayer has been alternatively shit and focused on blasters solving every problem, which basically just makes the specific game a first person shooter.  Imagine massive Jedi fights like the ones in the (only good scenes of) Episode 2, and you can imagine what <em>Star Wars </em>multiplayer should be like.  Jedi on Jedi action, with some folks with blasters doing damage with ingenuity and guile.  Frankly, it's a shame there's no quality <em>Star Wars </em>multiplayer game that's been released in the last couple of years, because perhaps the multiplayer story of new games journalism <a href="http://www.alwaysblack.com/blackbox/bownigger.html" target="_blank">came from the franchise's very annals</a>. 

In total, I just want to be a Jedi: not the modern creature of rage popularized by Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side, but rather a wise, peaceful man who could kick everyone's asses.  And if games want to be anything, it is wish fulfillment. That is my wish. I know Lucasarts would rather have me wave my arms about like an asshole in a setting inspired by the prequels instead of being a paragon of virtue in an action RPG setting, but this isn't about them. This is about <em>Jedi Academy</em>, and how I wish there were another one, so that when I begin one of my frequent pilgrammiges back to Yavin 4 I could do it in a different, superior game.

*SOMEONE WROTE ALL OF THIS. THIS IS 47850 WORDS. ABOUT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER FROM NOVELS BASED OFF A MOVIE BY A GUY WHO THINKS HE SHOULD GO BACK DECADES LATER TO MAKE HIS PUPPETS BLINK. AND SOMEONE WROTE IT.


**The game's creators, Raven Software, went on to make another personal favorite of mine, <em>X-Men Legends</em>. They clearly knew how to deal with licenses. It's a shame Activision has them making user interfaces for <em>Call of Duty </em>now.  Raven Software, I feel for you.]]></content:encoded>

A while back, I was pouring over the forums for the upcoming Star Wars: The Old Republic.  I’m easy to pick out - I’m the one usually bitching about canonical representation of blaster bolt physics and petitioning for the inclusion of Kawakian Monkey-Lizards as a playable race.  Anyway, one of the threads I stumbled upon had commented that same-sex relationships, so prevalent in the Dragon Age series, seemed to be absent from The Old Republic.

Seeing as how cogent socio-political discussion gets on about as well on internet forums as Jack Thompson at a Doom LAN party, I promptly backed out of the thread.  Yet somehow I had inadvertently picked up a takeaway from the discussion before it devolved into chaos.  Should game developers even be attempting to address larger social issues with their games?  Do they have a <em>right</em> to take on that task?  Do they have a <em>duty</em> to do so?

I guess, to clarify, I should state that I’m not interested in <em>how</em> games currently portray “morality.”  I don’t care about the specific merits of the Paragon/Renegade system; whether or not I think taking a Karma hit in Fallout is an appropriately severe punishment for nuking a city isn’t relevant to the discussion.  No, I’m interested in trying to take it a step further - do games have any business even talking to me about morality <strong>at all</strong>.

After all, games are just that - games, right?  Isn’t their primary purpose to entertain?  Don’t people play games specifically <em>not</em> to think about these things, or be preached to about moral issues?  If I’m paying hard-earned money for a game, I run the very real risk of being well and truly pissed if some mysterious Game Developer tries to shove his highfalutin’ “message” down my throat while I’m pwning n00bs.

The tricky thing about games is that they are a very unique and distinct medium, vastly different from books or even film, and this difference hinges on interaction.  A good film will make you empathize with the main character, whereas a good game will allow you to <em>become</em> the main character.  If I watch a movie with a gay supporting character and this makes me uncomfortable, I will be likely to simply follow the path of least resistance and just stop watching.  Similarly, if I boot up Dragon Age 2 and inadvertently stumble across Anders’ homosexual leanings (and let’s face it, it’s not hard to do.  The man’s an ex-Warden, he’s got a lot of pent up frustration), I may be similarly inclined to turn the game off.

The difference is that, though I empathize with movie characters, I am still separated from them, ever the observer.  Anders, however, is not merely a character, he is a <em>companion</em>.  I’ve <em>interacted </em>with him.  We’ve saved each other’s asses.  And at the end of the day, in spite of whatever my feelings on sexual orientation may be, I have come to value Anders as a person and as a member of my party.  Ours’ is a bond forged in battle and friendship, and that is not the type of bond that discriminates.

By creating an Anders that is gay (or, at the very least has the capacity to be gay), BioWare is not trying to force a lifestyle down anyone’s throat.  Rather, their design choice could be interpreted as an attempt to normalize a marginalized social group by naturalizing it in the game world.  In this way, I can familiarize myself with Anders on a human level through my direct interaction - I am more inclined to do this both because I face no risk of any actual “harm”, and also because I have a strong desire to complete the game.

Part of the magic of games is that they can give us experience with difficult social problems through this direct interaction.  They are thought experiments, actualized.  In games we have a unique opportunity to explore the deepest limits of our psyche to see what we’re really constructed of.  The beautiful thing is, because it’s a video game, there’s no external harm done to anyone.  And while the consequences may be fictional, if the game is good that doesn’t mean that they aren’t <em>real</em>, or at least impactful.  As a net result, we come out of our games having learned something about ourselves; we are literally more complete people.  To squander the unique opportunity that games as a medium of expression offers us in favor of mindless hack’n’slashes seems almost criminal.

Of course, video games’ imperative to explore complex issues is as functional as it is moral (I’m not <em>that</em> pretentious, after all).  At their heart, games basically consist of the player pushing buttons in specific sequences at specific times.  Developers have been refining this button-pushing exercise for so long that it’s reached an almost Spartan level of efficiency.  Games like Call of Duty and Dragon Age have turned button pushing and economy of controls into an art form.  The weird thing is, game design has become so efficient that things like button layout, user interface, and hell even plot most of the time seem so universal as to be indistinguishable from each other.  The unhappy consequence of reaching the pinnacle is that there is nowhere else to go, and so games nowadays tend to blur together.  Oftentimes it feels like going from Call of Duty to Halo isn’t even switching games, it’s just a different skin for the overall game, “First Person Shooter.”  Regardless of technical efficiency, ubiquity in video games is certainly something to be avoided.  Otherwise, when each game feels exactly the same, it’s easy to forget what game you’re even <em>playing</em>, let alone care about any of it.  Instead, it simply becomes a contest to see how quickly and how many times you can push a specific series of buttons.

So what do we do, then?  Recognize that, from a technical standpoint games have likely come as far as they can (at least for a while) and just stop making new games?  Do we adopt a crazy sort of Sunnyvale Syndrome where we recognize that the games are all carbon copies of each other, but we just go on and play them anyways?  No, the solution is that we must instead refine not <em>how</em> we play games, but <em>why</em>.  Game design has gotten so advanced that it’s now possible to render entire gameworlds with remarkably lifelike details, and voice acting in games has, in recent years become an art all its own.  Why not use these resources to create intricate stories for me to immerse myself in, or craft complex dilemmas that affect me through my character?  While it may be difficult to devise a control scheme or brand new interface that will shake the foundations of gaming, what <em>will</em> wow gamers these days is a game that, more than a mindless button-mash fest actually press our boundaries.  Start using the games to play the gamers as much as the other way around.  With gaming’s inherent interactivity, the potential is there to create incredibly complex and involving social, moral, political, or any other type of real-life issue that must be thought through as much as fought through.  For the sake of developing video games as a burgeoning art form, the next step has to be taken, and that step is to involve gamers’ minds as much as their fingers.

[caption id="attachment_10908" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="We get it. You do this very well."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/the-developers-moral-imperative-or-why-its-ok-for-anders-to-be-gay-10901/reload-montage-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-10908"><img class="size-full wp-image-10908" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/reload-montage1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="309" /></a>[/caption]

This all, of course, rests on the assumption that games are some new form of art, or at least a unique and distinct medium unlike anything we’ve seen before.  While you may or may not agree, what you can’t deny is that more and more developers are taking these risks.  Games like Catherine<em>, </em>L.A. Noire, and even Bastion<em> </em>have made huge names for themselves by being unafraid not only to engage with deep, often troubling themes, but to center around them.  The inevitable consequence of this, of course, is that some people will be put out.  However, instead of getting defensive, I actually view this as a good thing, since it means that games are succeeding at striking a nerve with people and getting to them on a deeper level.  Say no to simply being entertained by games, and instead demand to be enriched by them.]]></content:encoded>

Kotaku Australia are reporting that <em>Dead Space </em>and <em>Dante's Inferno</em> developer Visceral Games may be shut down by Monday.

An employee of the EA-owned Australian studio who asked to remain anonymous informed Kotaku that staff were told that the studio will be closed down on Monday. The developer has been working on an AAA title for the PS3 and Xbox 360 for the last three years, but Patrick Söderlund, former DICE CEO and current EA executive, opted to pull the plug on the developer, claiming that the game would likely not be profitable. <a title="Gamasutra" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/37297/Reports_EA_May_Close_Visceral_Melbourne_Studio_Monday.php" target="_blank">Gamasutra </a>are reporting that Melbourne's IGDA chapter and print newspaper The Age have received the same information, giving weight to the rumor.

Should the claim be true, Visceral Games' closure would mark the fourth Australia studio to get the axe in recent months, with Team Bondi now in administration, and the THQ shutting down Blue Tongue and THQ Brisbane in August.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fans of <em>Dragon Age</em> 2 will be able to extend their adventures with new DLC. <em>Mark of the Assassin</em> will bring Hawk back to Ferelden to accompany an elf assassin in a deadly mission. Bioware has revealed that this adventure will revolve around stealing a valuable treasure in completely new environments.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/new-dlc-announced-for-dragon-age-2-10927/da2-mota-wyvern-playground/" rel="attachment wp-att-10928"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10928" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/da2-mota-wyvern-playground-300x103.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="103" /></a>

"A precious relic, the Heart of Many, lies under heavy guard in a fortified Orlesian estate. Even the legendary Champion of Kirkwall is not equipped to retrieve it alone. To succeed in this quest, Hawke requires skilled assistance and must turn to an untested new ally. Internet superstar Felicia Day lends her vocal talents to revisit her role as the Tallis from the highly anticipated <em>Dragon Age: Redemption</em> web series. A mysterious elf assassin with an agenda of her own, she brings a stealthy combat style to the party."

<em>Mark of the Assassin</em> will release on October 11th.

		<title>A look into the Nintendo Ambassador Program: Or how the game Yoshi is the greatest threat to democracy.</title>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">When a company is in the video game market, it needs to be on top of the community, understand its user-base, and interface with them to sell product and keep them coming back for more. The company as an entity needs to be just as big a fan as its patrons, in the trenches of the hobby rubbing shoulders with its core users. </span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Or it can ignore all of those things and just do whatever the hell it wants, like Nintendo. It worked with the Wii, where they basically ignored every trend of the industry and every last fan to deliver a waggle simulator unrivaled on the market. As you may recall, this thing would consume the souls of disappointed gamers and shit cash all over Nintendo's offices like one of those yappy dogs that managed to eat laxative chocolates. Like that yappy dog, it would eventually expire in a pool of filthy money, prompting Nintendo to rethink its system, and cause them to release a handheld for its core base to help bridge the gap to its next console release. Since this article is anything but timely, you of course know the punchline to this joke. Nintendo didn't learn anything: it released the 3DS with confetti, fanfare, a whole bunch of people talking about how crazy glasses free 3D gaming is, and no games. The early adopters for this handheld are faced with what amounts to a calendar year of uninteresting releases and semi-interesting re-releases. Buyers couldn't return or sell the things fast enough once the first week of making Mii's fight through crappy dungeons had run its course. Nintendo needed to do something to keep people interested.</span>

[caption id="attachment_10952" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="I love that this was included with the games."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Certificate.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10952 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Certificate-1024x611.jpg" alt="I'm glad they included this with the games." width="614" height="367" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Enter the Ambassador program, where early adopters and people who had no problem buying from Walmart for the early price drop would be rewarded with twenty free games. I won't lie to you, I bought this paperweight from Walmart FOR those twenty free games. I, apparently, do not make the best life decisions. Unfortunately for an ambassador like myself, this wasn't twenty free games all in one go. We get ten NES games now, and we get ten GBA games... one day. What has driven me to write this angry article today is the fact that I didn't get ten NES games like I was promised. When I went to download my reward, I got the following titles:</span>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Super Mario Bros.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong Jr.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Balloon Fight</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Ice Climber</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The Legend of Zelda</span></div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">I count seven games, two hate crimes, and one affront to The Flying Spaghetti Monster or your hideous sky god of choice. Let's all just be honest for a second: does anyone recall ever seeing </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">anyone </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">enjoy playing </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong Jr.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> who wasn't covered in blood? Can you honestly even remember </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">NES Open Tournament Golf</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">? At all? No. You can't. It didn't exist until recently, when all of your tears of boredom that have ever seeped from your eyes coalesced into a malignant entity that resides at the center of Nintendo of America's headquarters. It alternates between screaming in the voice of a thousand angry babies and distributing its brood to 3DS systems around the world, so that it may generate more tears of boredom, and that it may grow even mightier. If you were a sensible person, had loving parents, or simply were born too late to be exposed to either of these yawn simulators, then count yourself lucky.</span>

<div>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Donkey Kong </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">was a classic arcade game. It was simple in its mechanics, and it provided a competitive environment for high scores, everything an arcade game needs to be if it wants to bring in quarters and create obsessive shut-ins for people to make documentaries about. Despite all that, I would argue that even </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> isn’t all that great outside of the arcade environment. High scores don’t mean that much on a console, death doesn’t require precious quarters, and in the comfort of your home you are probably looking for more compelling titles made for the console environment. Now replace </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">with </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong Jr. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and you have the same problems, but they are compounded by unresponsive controls, terrible level design, and a frustrating key gathering system that makes me give up after two levels without fail. It was frustrating as an arcade game, it was pointless as a port to the NES, and now it's a terrible addition to what should have been a list of classics.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">No one remembers </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">NES Open Tournament</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">, and I’m pretty sure that it's important it stays that way. Kind of a Lovecraft deal I bet, an unknowable horror best left in the shadows of the unseen. Just go play one of the </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Mario Tennis </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">games while hitting yourself in the head or something, and pretend I described that experience here.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Then we come to the affront to all that is good and decent in this world. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Yoshi</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. When the Geneva Convention finished its war crime trials following World War II, it was forced to stay in session for an additional week because someone in the room wrote a description of this game down on a napkin. Every terrible thing that has ever happened can be marginalized and trivialized by placing it next to a copy of this game. When you suck all warmth, love, happiness, and fun out of a room, the resulting vacuum is more entertaining then this game, which exists only in the </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">shadow </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">of that vacuum. The Lament Configuration is more fun to play, and it is a more satisfying puzzle to boot.</span>

[caption id="attachment_10957" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Not even Cenobites will touch Yoshi."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Pinhead.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10957 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Pinhead-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="345" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">This game is so bad that it nearly killed me, but to hear that story you first need to know about the game itself. Like any child, the character of Yoshi captured my heart and imagination. It was a fucking dinosaur, could eat bad guys, had special powers when it ate certain things, and some of them were rare breeds with even more special powers. This game says to hell with all that, what people want is a painfully slow simulation of crap falling and filling eggs once in awhile. You play Mario, and Mario’s job is to swap any two columns out of four so that falling monsters become paired and wink out of existence. If you let any one column touch the ceiling, then you are either dead, or you </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">fled</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> the television out of desperation. In either event, this causes a game over. The enemies fall slightly faster than feathers in the vacuum of space, there are only four enemy types you need to worry about matching, and sometimes Yoshi egg half-shells fall and allow you to fill the eggs with mismatched baddies to </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">wink</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> the package away. That’s it. That is the whole of the experience. Everything is randomized and skill isn’t available for comment, much less involved in play. It gets boring before you even finish one round.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Notice how I said you play Mario? Yoshi isn’t involved in this game named after him; he just stands around and watches Mario struggle. As a jaded adult, I can’t help but imagine this is some kind of dream Yoshi is having, a </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Saw </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">like fantasy where Yoshi is exacting his revenge on Mario. Think about it, for years Yoshi has been letting some fat, sweaty plumber </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">punch him in the back of the head </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">whenever the plumber felt like letting him eat something. He gets used as a disposable double-jump, just tossed into pits like trash. Its an abusive relationship, and only worse when you consider the events of </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Yoshi’s Island </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and how that baby would grow to become such a dick. So Yoshi dreams of locking Mario in a box and just pouring enemies in after him, along with the broken eggs that represent his shattered dreams. Of course, like so many of these relationships, Yoshi has a bit of Stockholm Syndrome going on, and his subconscious keeps the enemies moving slowly and allows the eggs to help the plumber. As emotionally unfulfilling as that dream is, its nothing compared to the experience of playing the game.</span>

<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Once, long ago, a friend and I had stayed awake for several days in a row. Being intelligent young men, we added alcohol to the mix, and decided that if we were going to die, it would have happened already. We were laughing at anything, and it didn't matter if it was funny or not; we were entertained by carpet. To put it bluntly, you could have slapped us and threatened our families, and we would have had a good time with it. We were the perfect audience for a shitty game to finally entertain! We jumped on the Wii's virtual console and downloaded it, because the name Yoshi still meant something to us. After one round, I was suddenly cold, as if all joy was lost to me. After two rounds my friend died for five minutes, before I managed to revive him. We fell asleep in the middle of deciding if a third round was worth trying, and the game somehow managed to leave us arranged in compromising positions, and then it uploaded the pictures to my </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Wii’s</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> friend list.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">All of that was on the highest difficulty and the fastest speed. A baby falling down a flight of stairs could win a match of </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Yoshi</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. It's not a game. It's a mean joke, and its inclusion in the Ambassador program just magnifies its evil. Its like if Netflix had an ambassador program that included a snuff film, an edit of </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The Room </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">that had only the sex scenes, and that video that kills you from </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The Ring</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. The other seven movies could all be classics, but every time you thought about them your mind would wander to those three unspeakable things that they shipped along for the ride. You can watch some sad souls play these three, “games,” on Youtube if you don’t believe me, or you can hunt them down and actually play them if you hate yourself that much.</span>

<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">It's not like it would have been hard to fill those slots with other titles either. Here, watch me do it on the fly. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Kid Icarus </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">could be one,</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> to go along with the new version coming out... one day. See, no thinking was even involved to find a classic</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">it pairs with a future release. Lets do another one, shall we? </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">A swift kick to the balls</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. It's more entertaining then </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong Jr.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and more rewarding then </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Yoshi. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Alright, one more. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Any other game that has ever existed on the NES</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. Any of them! </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Super Mario 2</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">! </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The Lost Levels</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">! Fucking </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Tetris</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">! It doesn't matter, you could have replaced </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Yoshi </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">with a picture of a dead puppy and I would have rated that as a better addition to the ten.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Surely they will do better with the GBA releases, right? Lets look at whats been confirmed thus far, and what has been rumored.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Confirmed thus far are:</span>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Mario Kart: Super Circuit</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Metroid Fusion</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</span></div>
<div>
<div>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Yoshi's Island </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">is one of my favorite games of all time, so that forgives </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Donkey Kong Jr. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">in my eyes, and </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Metroid Fusion </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">was also pretty great, enough so that I will forget about that tennis game I already forgot about. The other three are just fine. I never played </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">, but it was received positively, and it actually looks fun to play. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">WarioWare </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Mario Kart </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">are always fun to some extent, regardless of where in the franchise you look. So far so good Nintendo, but I still haven't forgiven you for </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Yoshi</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. How about the rumored games?</span></span>

[caption id="attachment_10954" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Seriously, the worst tennis game ever."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NES-Open-Tournament-Golf.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10954 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NES-Open-Tournament-Golf-1024x583.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="350" /></a>[/caption]

<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Rumored inclusions thus far are:</span>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</span></span></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">These two are all but confirmed from what I can tell, with most places just outright saying they will be included. So its a safe bet that these two will be included in the package. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Mario 3 </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">is one of the best iterations of the series, and it tied in with the new 3DS Mario game that will come out... one day. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Kirby </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">is basically incapable of doing wrong in my eyes, so these two are good choices by Nintendo. Those of you with pattern recognition skills are now realizing that we have seven GBA games listed, much like how we only had seven NES games listed. Will Nintendo include more awesome games, like </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap, Mario and Luigi: Super Star Saga</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">, </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire, </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">or just hedge its bets and go with the gold standard of </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">This program is supposed to be Nintendo’s way of saying sorry to anyone who rode the hype train they put together. It was supposed to be a big box of games for a device that actually seemed like it was going out of its way to have the saddest release library it could. The NES has a massive library full of classic and memorable games, and picking just ten great ones isn’t hard, so putting together a mediocre spread as the introduction to the program just feels like an insult. Including the crappy sequel to a classic arcade game, the tennis game that time forgot, and one of the least compelling puzzle games ever made doesn’t make me feel proud to own this thing. </span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Which is why they really need to nail those last few GBA games. They need to be either great gaming experiences, or nostalgia filled milestones of the company; they need to remind us about the good times we had with Nintendo, and make us think that perhaps we will one day have some great new content on this handheld.</span>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Or they can just give us </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Pitfall! Mayan Adventure </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and force me to take drastic measures toward ending all of mankind.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hmmm... Honestly, of the 10 nes games i have recieved, i enjoy playing "yoshi" the most. 

I've tried them all.

Donkey kong jr - Get to the top, its filled with enemies waiting in ambush. Can't go under them because of barrels, and cant jump barrels because every enemy the game can handle is stuck at the end.
Stopped at level 2 - don't think i'll play that again.

Super Mario Bros. - Brutal on such a tiny screen. Has its moments, but i find myself rushing through levels as fast as i can, taking every warp pipe along the way. Get to the 5th world in less than a minute, then die, stare, and play yoshi.

Balloon Fighter - Need to give this one a better go. Far too easy and repetitive.

Metroid - Painfully difficult. Enemies get stuck on the side, and remove twice as much health as you can find in 10 minutes. Good luck finding enough missiles near the start to pass that one bit...

Ice climber - Jumping system makes me want to cry. Finally jump up 3 ice stacks - fall - then sit there jumping straight up over and over again...

Wrecking Crew - I cannot for the life of me figure out what the hell i'm supposed to do on this game.

Zelda - A good game, but i really can't be bothered playing it again.

Zelda II - This game raises my blood pressure till i pass out. Finished this once, and i don't think i'll ever want to finish it again.

And lastly - Nes Golf something something.
After taking 20 minutes of my life just figuring out how to hit the ball, i hit it, watched it land, didn't understand, gave up, and declared it the worst game ever.

So again, Yoshi is my favorite of the nes games so far, and i don't know why. Its easy, its slow, its painfully random, and offers no challenge or competitiveness at all.

Never cared for nes games. My own nes only ever saw me play mario 3, duck hunt, and battle toads.]]></wp:comment_content>

As for you liking Yoshi most of all, this is actually a symptom of several very dangerous disorders, and I urge you to seek medical help for enjoying a game like that.";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:5:"10948";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:4:"2931";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"773b594ad6";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"TnkTSc26rBMAAFYVORQAAAAG";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:10:"1199276153";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:63:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:13:"gzip, deflate";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:141:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/a-look-into-the-nintendo-ambassador-program-or-how-the-game-yoshi-is-the-greatest-threat-to-democracy-10948/";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1104";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

To state that the flash game <em><a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/BentoStudio/space-trooper-usa" target="_blank">Space Trooper U.S.A.</a> </em>is “light on story” would be akin to observing that the Pacific Ocean “really isn’t that small, when you think about it”. It doesn’t so much lack a story as it does actively resist attempts to have one. Where other games might be content to give you a few text-only cutscenes, <em>Space Trooper U.S.A. </em>just sneers upon your pathetic human need for context or reason. Oh yes, you’ll get a story, but it’s comprised of one sentence, randomly generated, and usually has about as much to do with the game as the dictionary entry for “Aardvark”. Because that’s the way <em>STUSA</em> rolls: back in <em>STUSA</em>’s day, they didn’t have any of your nandy-pandy “cutscenes”. All they had for story was text and pain, and you had better well learn to like it too.

While I can glean little of the <em>STUSA </em>universe through the game, I can rest assured that it is not one with a kind and loving god. You start out on a tiny asteroid with a rifle and incoming waves of insectoid aliens, and it’s your job to combine the two in creative ways until you’ve died the most horrible death that you can come up with under the circumstances. It isn’t clear why this particular hunk of rock is so strategically important, or who hated the space marine enough to send him to guard it, or why the insects are so happy to oblige, or even which of the three is part of the titular U.S.A. Like I said, <em>STUSA</em> is primarily occupied with throwing chitinous exoskeletons at you until you until you can be properly described as “maimed”. If you manage to survive for longer than a few minutes, something the game takes as a personal offense, it will start producing a larger class of enemies that violently explode when shot. That may not sound all that horrible, considering explosions are to video games what the color green is to paintings, but in this case the explosions gradually destroy the surface of the planet, exposing the molten core (if you’re wondering why it doesn’t freeze when exposed to the vacuum of space, you obviously haven’t been paying attention) and eventually leaving you stranded on an island in an ocean of lava, casually wondering if you have enough time to roast a few marshmallows before the next wave (you don’t). You can try repairing the ground with a particular powerup, but only in the same sense that you can try to contain theThames with a sieve, since the game unloads exploders at you at a rate roughly comparable to the rain.

So you’re going to die. But at least it’ll be a fun death. <em>STUSA</em> is really the inevitable end result of what happens when somebody puts the greatest possible effort into the simplest possible concept. The graphics are good for a flash game, which is to be expected from a game running on the Unity engine, and the visual style is distinct enough that you can recognize what you’re supposed to shoot and what you aren’t (namely, everything and nothing, respectively).. Controls work well- you point in a general direction, horrible monsters die, etc. The bombastic musical score is clearly having the time of its life, and syncs up well with the metallic voice of the announcer, whom I suspect to be the unforgiving god I mentioned earlier. The powerups are distributed evenly enough for you to feel like an unstoppable engine of destruction just when the bigger enemies arrive to rob you of that notion, and your secondary weapon, the plasma gun, is obscenely powerful enough to produce a vast number of tearful insect widows when it’s used, but has enough drawbacks (i.e. destroying the ground you’re standing on) to keep from <em>seeming </em>obscenely powerful. There isn’t a lot to this game, but just about all of it is done right.

Now, conventional games criticism demands that I break down the points of the game like that, but it’s really doing the game a disservice. The experience of the game is the more important part. As the game starts, you’re immediately plunked down on a gray sphere and given a few seconds of peace before the carnage begins. The first few waves require a few shots to bring down an individual enemy, but that’s a circumstance that the game doesn’t tolerate for very long. At the five minute mark, you’ve collected enough powerups the individual enemy poses about as much threat as a hostile fruit fly does to an elephant. You’re mowing down wave after wave of vague shapes that have ceased to be threats and instead have become walking sacks full of points. The lava is beginning to become a minor annoyance, but easy enough to manage on your way to kamikaze one of the insect hives with the “Invincibility” powerup. Eventually the combat starts to get to your head, and you spontaneously begin shouting things like “I AM A COMBINE HARVESTER, AND YOU ARE ALL STALKS OF CORN!” Eventually, of course, you die, but only after leaving behind enough dead bugs to fill an entire building’s supply of windowsills. This is a game that is seriously undercut by that lack of a feature that allows you to stand atop the corpses of your foes. It’s pure cathartic violence, free of context or logic.

However, <em>STUSA</em>’s simplicity and glorious absence of plot winds up also being its main drawback. There’s no boss or other endgame content if you survive long enough: like I said, this game was programmed mainly with your demise in mind. Once you’ve played the game for twenty minutes, you’ve seen all it has to offer. The enemies, while gradually getting darker in color, and thus meaner by video game logic, never really show much variety throughout the game. You run out of places to stash your powerups after a while and the game just starts throwing “Invincibility” at you, which is fully necessary, because, you know, lava, but that doesn’t keep it from getting a bit tiresome. If you’re that sort of person, you can replay to top your high score, but every game plays out the exact same way, to the point where you might start to wonder if it’s really Bill Murray in that space marine armor. With the gameplay feeling the same and not even an excuse for a story gently reminding you that you aren’t done yet, there really isn’t a reason to keep going short of trying to figure out whether or not there’s actually some sort of deep sociological subtext that you missed the last time around.

<em>Space Trooper U.S.A. </em>is a well-crafted game with a single-minded focus on gameplay. It works brilliantly for a short while, but doesn’t have enough content to make it work for more than that long. What we have here is a game that has magnificently succeeded at making you feel like a god of death while still eventually reminding you that, no, you aren’t, and that’s a better foundation than a lot of other games that I’ve seen lately. If somebody can build a better house on that foundation, a house filled with a variety of weapons and enemies, with varying terrain, death traps, and maybe, god forbid, a plot, then I for one would certainly not want to live on the same street as that house. But I would probably love the game.]]></content:encoded>

Depicting love isn't easy--this is true of any medium that explores the subject. Love is a feeling, perhaps the most subjective of them all, and so far no medium has gained fame for its ability to make the consumer fall in love. Other feelings may be felt, explored: Silent Hill might make you frightened, Tai's suicide in Gears 2 might be upsetting, but it's unlikely that something will make <em>you fall in love.</em>

Naturally, video games still explore the subject. Here is my question, then: is exploring the nuance and different facets of love enough in an interactive environment? Can a depiction of love in an interactive environment only be considered to be successful if the player falls in love, too?

Or maybe love isn't possible in a game. Love is a story about two people. Games tend to be the glorification of one person, and it’s not the avatar in that awkward sex cutscene. That person is you, the player.

Design wise, love tends to be a prize--plenty of girls are like Paula, from Shadows of the Damned--or an optimization puzzle, if only because it's almost impossible <em>not</em> to approach a game that way. So then, if we cannot currently fall in love, could we at least see a convincing depiction of love? I'm willing to bet that most of us can only count a couple of convincing, non-simplistic depictions at best in the medium. Further question: when was the last time you saw love depicted in a flawed, ugly, or depressing, way; when was the last time you saw love as the nuanced thing that it is?

[caption id="attachment_11010" align="aligncenter" width="558" caption="Poster children for what love usually looks like in a game"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/lloyd.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11010" title="lloyd" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/lloyd.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="287" /></a>[/caption]

Not very often, right? I think there's a reason for that: games exist to please people, they are designed to be escapism or indulgence, a fantasy. If a love interest exists, it's been written specifically for the player, like a blow-up doll of some sort--think of how Anders in Dragon Age 2 is available to you regardless of your gender. The ability to present a nuanced depiction of love is severely lessened when a love interest exists to be another pawn in a power fantasy, another optimization puzzle.

What we're getting at here is that the very interactivity of the medium, the very game-ness of a game, is what compromises the ability to successfully depict love. Love and romance become about the result, the prize.

And yet, there are moments which have come close to transcending those common pitfalls. What comes immediately to my mind is--and I'm sure this will surprise no one, if you've read anything I've written--Morrigan from Dragon Age. To give some background--and do not mistake this for me stating this is a completely successful depiction of love, because it really is a singular moment--Morrigan, like any character voiced by Claudia Black, is an impossible character. Impossibly stubborn, independent, pragmatic, cold...and immensely titillating. You spend the entire game bumping heads with her, regardless of how you interact with her.

Morrigan is a deeply flawed character. She's been raised in such a way that makes her believe that love and compassion are synonymous with weakness. I spent the entire game trying to show her otherwise. The moment where she finally admits, despite her fear, despite her hesitation, despite her very nature, that she may be in love with you, is somewhat touching.

This is a fleeting feeling, though, like most beautiful moments are. Morrigan cannot fight against her nature, in spite of her 'love' for you. She's gone on this journey with you because she wants something, and that something is power. She wants to have a god-baby, and you or a fellow warden will impregnate her to achieve this. The thing is, no matter what you do, no matter how she feels about you, she leaves. If you impregnate her, she leaves to raise the baby. If you don't impregnate her, she leaves because you refused her.
<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/morrigan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11013" title="morrigan" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/morrigan.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="216" /></a>
I have no power but to accept this fate. There is no skill check, no dialogue option, no QTE, no different choice path, no reloading that can change this moment.

This isn't what things would look like if I could convince her to stay. Nonetheless, this moment is powerful because I have no choice but to accept it. Though the fact that she is a love interest that can be won over is true, though her affection is denoted via numbers in a bar, in spite of both those simplifications of love, that last moment where she leaves you behind felt like a truer depiction of love and it's nuances, its conflicts and its flaws than just about everything else I've played. This was only possible because interactivity and agency were stripped away from me.

Maybe one day, when we live in a Kurzweillian future where the AI in games think for themselves and cannot be 'gamed,' we might also have the (admittedly insane-sounding) ability to make video games a medium that can make its consumers fall in love. That's the only way I can see love that involves two "people" working, at least. For now, the best we can do is explore the subject, and I hope that developers are not afraid to stop pandering, are not afraid to delve into true, complex nuance in order to give justice to that feeling called love.]]></content:encoded>

Human Revolution released to pretty much universal praise. However, one thing that stuck out are the game’s boss battles. They have been criticized as uninspired, boring, forcing you to fight no matter what, and for being generally out-of-place in an otherwise great game.

Well, it seems that we have a reason for all that now. The boss fights in Deus Ex were outsourced to a different company, G.R.I.P. Entertainment. G.R.I.P. mainly does general AI work and NPC design for other games. A behind-the-scenes video recently hit Youtube, which illustrates G.R.I.P.’s approach to the battles, how they worked with Eidos Montreal, and the tech behind it all. It’s also worth noting that G.R.I.P.’s CEO is a “shooter guy”, which would help explain why shooting was more or less the only way to handle the battles.

Welcome back for another week of potentially warm discussion!

Bosses have a long history in video games, and have recently been catching flak because they're a holdover from the early days of games that seem to shove their way into every title, <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/deus-ex-human-revolution-outsourced-its-boss-battles-11025/">no matter how appropriate</a>.  Of course, nothing gets the blood going like a good boss battle.  You can see both sides.

Personally, my favorite boss battle of all time is simple: Magus, from Chrono Trigger.  Sure, he's easy now that I'm an experienced gamer, but when I was a kid he was one of the hardest fights ever, and the music always gets me going.  Really, that's what I want from a boss battle: I want it to make me appreciate that I'm playing this game instead of something else, and Magus did that.]]></content:encoded>

I guess no discussion on bosses would be complete without mentioning Megaman, which is probably (I'm not doing any research here) the originator of the modern-day boss.

The Shin Megami Tensei games probably have my favorite boss battles though. Every fight seems to straddle the line between difficulty and cheapness perfectly. Not to mention they have some of the hardest bosses of all time as bonus fights (Elizabeth anyone?).

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I was just thinking about something like this today. First thought that popped into my head was Tiny Tiger from Crash Bandicoot 2. The fight's actually ridiculously easy, but I love the boss battles music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thr1xb9bv8g For a fight that has good gameplay and music, I'd nominate N. Gin from the same game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLw777pIXgo N. Gin in CB 3 was also a tough bastard.

I've mentioned him before, but Fire Leo from Viewtiful Joe also stands out. The very first time I attempted the fight, I was like: "This is impossible. No way." Then, after getting the pattern down, I beat him. Triumph@ And then I beat him on V Rated. And then I had to get the pattern down again before beating him on Ultra V Rated. He is brutal (at least at first), but I think he's a great example of an enjoyable boss battle. since he's challenging like boss status should imply, but he can also still be beat. Shame that Ice Leos appear as a weaker an overused enemy though.

Clock-La of Sly Cooper 2 was also good. There was this game-spanning story leading you to believe that you'd fight a reincarnation of Clockwerk, but in the end you get to fight something a bit different than what you expected. One of the best parts about this boss is that it patrols a level before the actual boss fight in a way that greatly enhances its deadliness and the fear you feel regarding it.

Some other memorable boss battles:

Zurt Zisa - Kingdom Hearts 1
Sephiroth, Grim Reaper, and Luxord - Kingdom Hearts 2
Mimi - Super Paper Mario (The game show and boss battle itself was pretty good, but the Exorcist and spider monster stuff if someone you'd expect out of Silent Hill, not Mario.)

I'm almost certain I have more examples of great boss battles, but few else come to mind at the moment....]]></wp:comment_content>

So, I've been thinking. I've written at least two hundred articles on this here blog. Assuming that the average length is about six hundred words, I've written about two small novels on video games. And these numbers are conservative.

I think it's time I leveled up!
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tom's leveled up!</strong>
<strong> CLA +2 points!</strong>
<strong> INS +1 points!</strong>
<strong> IDA +4 points!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHOA!</strong>
<strong> AUD +12 points!</strong></p>
From now on, expect much more enjoyable blog entries! ...Aw fuck, it doesn't work like that, does it?

Our knowledge of how people learn has expanded dramatically in the past few decades, and it bears absolutely no resemblance to how our avatars improve in video games. In real life, we learn by doing, and doing lots of times (as per Malcolm Gladwell's pop science in Outliers). In video games, we fight monsters, get some experience, and then we level up in arbitrary steps by reaching specific, discrete thresholds.

The mythical “RPG Elements” of modern video games spring directly from old tabletop games, Dungeons and Dragons specifically. In Dungeon and Dragons, you level along a linear chart, filling in your statistics based off of what some writer thousands of miles away said you should be getting. Every level two warrior is going to get an increased base attack bonus, even if he didn't punch a single thing on the way there.

This system makes a lot of sense for pen and paper: you have a human brain, rather than a computer, making all the calculations. We don't want to have to record how many times we hit an enemy with a sword to figure out how much strength we'd gain upon gaining a level. That sounds terrible. We want everything figured out for us, because there's loot to hunt and dice to roll!

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_dice.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_dice.jpg" alt="" title="leveling_dice" width="450" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11071" /></a>

In video games, it makes about as much sense as a whale inside a lunch box. The earliest video games directly aped this system: gain five hundred experience points, get one strength and two int (never intelligence. If you don't have enough int to know what it stands for, you probably don't need it). But, even in video games' nascent stages, developers realized they could construct much more organic systems. This led to two other “mother” systems emerging: the first tried to simulate real life by calculating how much we did things to determine our statistics, and the other gave us some sort of currency we could reinvest into our character's development, usually down one of two or three different paths.

Let's start with the second one, in part because it's the one most resembling how we really learn, in other part because it just makes me so angry. The first game I'm aware of that tried to level players up naturally, as they did things, was Final Fantasy II for the NES. Obviously, we didn't play that game until around 2000 in the West, so our first experiences with “organic” leveling are different. For me, that game was the oft-forgotten SaGa Frontier, a game with good grammatical sense that you had to play through seven times to get the real ending.

Here's how you leveled up in SaGa Frontier, in theory: you took character A (let's call him “Lute”, and make him a frustratingly underpowered musician with a cool character design) and decided to make him a wizard. “He is a wizard!” you call to the heavens. You give him some spells, a useless healing spell and an equally useless attack spell. They're useless because he doesn't have any MP. You use one of them, and then, at the end of the battle, he spins around five times: MAG UP! VIT UP! INT UP! CHM UP! WP UP! Suddenly his spells are a little less useless. Sounds really good. He learned by doing.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_SaGa.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_SaGa.jpg" alt="" title="leveling_SaGa" width="450" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11072" /></a>

In reality, it didn't work like this. You took Lute out to fight an enemy, and because he was as dangerous as a wet dog, he died before he could cast a spell. If he managed to survive, he didn't cast anything, and he didn't get any stat raises for doing nothing. After three hours and only meager returns, you replaced him with a better character you recruited off the street, who learned more by sitting around gyrating in place than Lute did fighting a hundred battles. We think nothing can be worse.

Well, until we play Oblivion, which is even more infuriating. Oblivion has become, for better or worse, the poster child for terrible leveling systems, and it does so by taking the worst parts of the D&amp;D system of “LEVEL UP!” moments and the worst parts of organically developing skills. Oblivion lets you learn by doing, which is a fantastic mechanic up until the point where you realize if you level up your main skills too quickly, you'll gain a lot of terrible levels, and the enemies will scale past you like you're a nobody.

So it's important to not level too quickly. That's the entire problem with organic leveling: you can do it wrong by playing the game.

Here's an actual, true story of me playing Oblivion, which I've recently decided to replay: my lovely level three Dark Elf is one skill away from leveling. She needs to level up two points of blunt or blade so she can get five points of strength upon leveling up, because otherwise she'll only get three or four points of strength and will fall behind the leveling race with the rats of the world. I'm in a cave, surrounded by monsters. My relevant skills (Blade, Restoration, Conjuration, and Destruction) are all major skills and all very close to leveling, which they can't do because then I wouldn't get very much strength. I find a sort of boss enemy, a wizard, and, for the sake of leveling up properly, I go at him with my rusty war axe of incompetence instead of, you know, doing anything I'm actually good at. All so I can level up properly.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Leveling_2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Leveling_2.jpg" alt="" title="Leveling_2" width="450" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11073" /></a>

I don't even need to explain how shitty this is. I'm going to stop before I stab myself through the eye with a trowel. Let's move on. Please.

The third system of leveling, incremental increases bought using fun bucks, is a more modern invention, created so that RPG elements could be added to any game. It's probably the best, too, if we don't consider hybrids. You kill enemies, collect moon currency, and then use it to make dynamic choices in how you specialize your character. Usually you have two or three paths to choose from, and you better specialize in one, or else you're going to be useless later in whichever game it is.

It's a decent system, though, despite how utterly arbitrary it is. For one, it emphasizes player choice, which is the foundation of a compelling leveling system. Something throwaway like inFamous can be exciting because it lets you take agency in how you develop your abilities. You get to make choices, and you feel empowered in your self-improvement, instead of a slave to some arbitrary, hateful system.

With those three principles in mind, we'll attack another question: what's the best leveling system? Have we seen the best yet? What qualities do they possess?

The best systems, in general, mix these elements up into their own brand of delicious experiental stew. Two, in particular, stand out in my book, and they are both quite different: Digital Devil Saga 2 and Fallout: New Vegas (Fallout in general).

Let's start with Digital Devil Saga 2 (part of the Shin Megami Tensei family), because it presents one of the more complicated looking, yet extremely elegant systems of character improvement. At its heart, it presents us with a fairly traditional system where you gain experience, level up, and then put points into one of five statistics, of which only three are of any use. Pretty traditional so far. But then you add this:

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_SMT.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_SMT.jpg" alt="" title="leveling_SMT" width="450" height="354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11074" /></a>

That's the Mantra grid. <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps2/924460-shin-megami-tensei-digital-devil-saga-2/faqs/39365">Here it is in full</a>. As you played the game, you could buy specific tiles on this grid to level up. When you bought them, you had to eat enough of your enemies to unlock it; what this basically meant was you had to fight a lot of battles, managing what your characters should devour. This move lets you give one person more Mantra experience, but could also result in them being unable to get any Mantra experience for the fight.

Effectively, DDS' greatest success was in creating two synergistic systems, one of which let you define the character's role in the party, while the other determined what specific moves the individual would have access to. They coupled this last system with a risk/reward mechanic which added significant complexity and a dynamic nature to how battles themselves played out. Simple battles could be made more complex by allowing the player to use specific moves to get more experience. The game blended together a lot of different elements to make a system that made you want to grind, because you were always a step away from something much more powerful.

Contrast this with Fallout's much loved leveling system, which takes the straightforward leveling nature of tabletop games and runs with it as far as it will go. Fallout's system is a recreation of the GURPS tabletop system, where you level up and put points into different skills, but made into a fun, dynamic thing. In New Vegas, specifically, all the skills you could get were valuable, but you didn't get enough points to develop all of them. You had to make tough choices about which sorts of paths you wanted to walk down, whether to be a lover, a fighter, or someone who repairs robots and lets them love and fight for you. This, coupled with the ubiquitous perks system, which lets you take new, game changing powers and skills, led to crunchy level ups.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_fallout.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/leveling_fallout.jpg" alt="" title="leveling_fallout" width="450" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11075" /></a>

That's the thing we're looking for in experience systems, what we're looking for different from real life. In real life, there's no satisfying moment where you realize you're brilliant at something. It just...happens. One minute you can't make a piece of toast without setting the house on fire, and the next you can make crème brulee. There's a process, but you never realize it until you've gotten to the end. In video games, there are satisfying moments of crunch in the middle, where, suddenly, you have an extra point of strength and can one shot those enemies. There's a point where your hacking is good enough to solve this computer puzzle, and there's a point where it's not. That point, however, is strictly delineated, and we can find it and define it, and that makes us feel good about ourselves. It gives us goals we can figure out how to surmount.

This is what we want from our leveling: we want the crunch of improvement and the ability to plan out our futures. We want to feel like the problems we face are surmountable, but only if we're better, more experienced. We need to see problems we could solve, and then we want to go out and find the ability to solve them. There's a moment of satisfaction to it that greases the hinge of leveling, and turns it from something pointless into something fantastic.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Battlefield 3 Open Beta Coming September 29th</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[EA's Peter Moore revealed that <em>Battlefield 3</em> will be launching an open beta at the end of the month, allowing players to experience the upcoming blockbuster before the October 28 release date.

The beta will provide a taste of what is sure to be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year. Featuring the new Frostbite engine, Moore promises that <em>Battlefield 3</em> will provide a true to life experience that will immerse the player into the most realistic environments ever created.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhBjBy5OOFY&amp;feature=player_embedded

He also highlights the incorporation of vehicles by writing, <em>"Battlefield </em>is also the only shooter game that will let you jump in and out of combat vehicles on the fly. Soldiers in the real world go from jeeps to tanks to helicopters – whatever it takes to accomplish the mission at hand."

Although Moore helped launch <em>Halo 2</em>, apparently he has forgotten that the <em>Halo</em> series has allowed gamers the same opportunity to utilize vehicles for years.

The beta will run from September 29th to October 10th and will feature Rush mode on the Operation Metro map. Stats will not carry over from the beta to the game and some bugs are to be expected. <em>Battlefield 3</em> will be available on the PS3, XBOX 360, and PC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fresh off the pages of 4chan (so take this with a grain of salt), a supposed Nintendo document has been leaked revealing the name and logo of the newest entry in the much beloved Smash Bros series. Incorporating the Wii-U's already silly name to make something that sounds even worse, the game is set to be called Super Smash Bros. U-niverse. While it remains unconfirmed at this time, Nintendo revealed at this year's E3 that a new Smash Bros game is headed to the Wii-U and 3DS, with support for cross platform connectivity between the two version.

Despite a troubled release and disappointing critical reception, THQ are convinced that <em>Homefront</em> is an IP worth building. The publisher today announced that <em>Crysis</em> developer Crytek will develop a sequel to the paranoid FPS, taking over from the now-defunct Kaos Studios.

"Selecting Crytek to take <em>Homefront </em>forward underscores our strategy of working with the industry's best talent. <em>Homefront</em>'s unique setting and storyline captivated gamers the world over," said THQ's executive VP, Danny Bilson of the move.

He added: "With Crytek's industry-leading technology and legendary experience in the FPS genre, we're supremely confident that the next <em>Homefront</em> will deliver that triple-A quality experience that players demand."

The title is slated for the 2014 fiscal year.

Ahem, sorry. Ubisoft has announced that PS3 copies of <em>Assassin's Creed: Revelations</em> will come bundled with a copy of the original <em>Assassin's Creed</em> on the Blu-Ray disk. It's a smart move considering that <em>Revelations</em> marks the return of the series' original protagonist, Altair. As a fan of the series since the beginning who owns the first three games already I'll be sticking with the 360 version, but this will give those late to the party a chance to play the first game in all of its amazing, albeit unrefined awesomeness. It's always nice to see goodies like this that aren't strictly preorder bonuses.

		<title>DRM removed from Bad Company 2</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/drm-removed-from-bad-company-2-11105/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bfbc2genscrnpistol1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11107" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bfbc2genscrnpistol1.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="293" /></a></p>
Better late than never, right? Today Bad Company 2 received a patch that removes the game’s annoying SecuROM DRM, and provides some minor performance upgrades and bug-fixes. However, DICE seems to have decided to include ALL previous patches in this one. So even if you already have all the other patches, you’ll still have to still download the full 2.6 gigabyte file.

The full list of changes are as follows:

-Removed some memory leaks
-Fixed crashes when the game attempted to render lots of content (high detail, high FOV or
multiple-monitor modes); this should particularly help multi-monitor users
-Chat window no longer causes lag spikes
-Chat window reworked opacity &amp; visibility-time is controllable through settings in settings.ini
-Clantag is remembered when using auto-login
-Banner URLs can be up to 252 characters in length
-SecuROM wrapper removed from non-Steam version
-Minor performance enhancements
-Reduced rubberbanding on servers with more than 24 active players
-PrintScreen takes a screenshot, file stored in Documents\BFBC2\Screenshots directory

Now, I’m glad they’re still supporting the PC version and all, but it seems kind of odd to bundle ALL patches with it. Especially when they’re not a lot of fixes. Kind of got a rude wake-up when I realized my PC was downloading a 2.6G file, but whatever.

For a bit more details and a dinosaur joke, head over to the <a href="//blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2011/09/18/battlefield-bad-company-2-patch-for-pc-to-be-released-on-wednesday.aspx##”"> Battlefield Blog </a>

Side note for the few interested in what the SecuROM actually did: when you install Bad Company 2 you get two choices: use a disk-based activation check to activate the game without having to connect to the internet, or activate it by connecting to EA's servers. The former lets you activate it if you have no connection, or an unreliable one, but you need to keep the disk in the tray to play. The latter lets you play without keeping the disk in the tray, but have to connect to the 'net to validate the game. It's a bit better than other activation methods, which don't give you any choice.]]></content:encoded>

As seen in the TGS11 trailer for <em>Kingdom Hearts 3D</em>, Neku from <em>The World Ends With You</em> (also known as Square Enix's best game in years) will be making an appearance in Sora's latest adventure. His role in the game is currently unknown, but his mere appearance has sparked rumors of a sequel to his own game. In a recent interview with Famitsu, creative director of both series Tetsuya Nomura rather delicately answered a question regarding a <em>WEWY</em> sequel explaining that the purple-clad hipster's appearance could be a hint at things to come. Take it how you will, but either way it's pretty awesome to see Neku rendered in 3D.

		<title>You Can Opt Out of Sony&#039;s New ToS</title>
		<link>http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/you-can-opt-out-of-sonys-new-tos-11124/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/law_and_order.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/law_and_order.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11130" /></a>

For those who don’t know, recently Sony released an updated Terms of Service(ToS) agreement. The new addition is as follows:

<i>"Any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general legal action, unless both you and the Sony entity with which you have a dispute specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration. This provision does not preclude your participation as a member in a class action filed on or before August 20, 2011."</i>

Basically, if you agree then you can’t perform class-action lawsuits against Sony for any problems you have with the PS3. Since you have to agree to the ToS to play online, it's either waive your right to sue Sony, or don't play online anymore. Not exactly a good thing for consumers, and it’s actually void in Europe and Australia due to laws in those regions which protect consumers from this sort of thing. Everywhere else though... no so much. However, for those not in Europe or Australia, you can still opt out after you agreed to the new terms. Just happens to be an opt-out clause:

<i>"If you do not wish to be bound by the binding arbitration and class action waiver in this Section 15, you must notify SNEI [Sony Network Entertainment] in writing within 30 days of the date that you accept this agreement."</i>

So if you still want to retain your right to participate in class-action lawsuits, you must send Sony a letter with you’re name, address, PSN account, and a “clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with any Sony entity through arbitration." Once you have that prepared, mail it to the following:

6080 Center Drive
10th Floor
Los Angeles, CA 90045
Attn: Legal Department/Arbitration
Attn: Sony Legal Department: Dispute Resolution

<a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/news/sonys-asking-you-to-waive-your-rights-but-you-have-options/3674/" />Giantbomb</a> has provided a <a href="//docs.google.com/document/d/1cXeHrCd-inBA4lCSk2P41tfA-HLeQEdMd-NKljOye9A/edit?hl=en_US”">handy template</a>.

What happens after that isn’t clear, but it’s still worth a shot.

It's a good thing that Sony provides people with a way to opt-out, but by burying this and the new clause in general in the ToS, there’s a very good chance that the majority of PSN users won’t even find out about it, since almost all never read the ToS. And doing this in the first place is... well pretty shitty, to put it bluntly.

Whether or not it’ll hold up in court is still up in the air. Chances are, that in the US at least, the US Federal Trade Commission and/or the various US Consumer Protection Agencies will step in. I don’t think it’ll hold up in the US, but it’s still better to be prepared. If you agreed to Sony’s new ToS recently, I suggest mailing them as soon as you can.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A while ago I wrote an article about the zombie genre, and why <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fnightmaremode.net%2F2011%2F08%2Flet-me-survive-9103%2F" target="_blank">it needed revitalization</a>. In it I voiced my concerns regarding Techland’s Dead Island, where I stated that it seemed to be too arcade-like rather than aiming for the more serious tone that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYicRlOm8c9Y" target="_blank">the game’s teaser hinted at</a>. Now I’ve finally had the opportunity to actually play it, and I’m afraid Dead Island is best described as a mixed bag.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>First, introductions are in order. Dead Island, like so many other games in the genre before it, is about stomping, crushing, smashing, shooting, burning, kicking and mutilating zombies in various inventive ways. As usual, a mysterious new virus suddenly emerges and transforms its victims into flesh-eating freaks, this time in the tropical paradise of Banoi. Predictably, the player(s) must go through a number of repetetive and deadly ordeals to make it off the island in one piece.</div>
<div><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dead_Island_Cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11142" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dead_Island_Cover.jpg" alt="" width="497" height="700" /></a></div>
<div>In the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of four characters that each specializes in different forms of combat. However, in my experience, it didn’t actually matter that much in the game. For instance, I chose a blunt weapon expert ready to crack skulls, but found myself mostly using my nifty little machete, that happened to also channel electricity into the undead, creating some <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FqKFW6.gif" target="_blank">rather entertaining moments</a>. But these moments are at the core of why Dead Island feels odd to play, as it seems to have dual personalities. On one side, it wishes to deliver that emotionally-laden storyline that will actually make the players care about the world and the plight of its inhabitants, instead of merely seeing them as XP-dispensers. And on the other side, it wants to be the game that four buddies can play together and have a blast, without feeling forced to think further than “kill zombies, acquire loot”. Of course, Techland’s marketing department has heavily emphasized the co-op part, but I still feel sort of cheated for the game not trying harder to achieve what the teaser promised. Techland had all the ground-work ready for such an experience, yet they chose not to pursue it. I guess those kind of zombies just sell better.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Dead Island is not completely devoid of these moments, though. Several instances, particularly in the first brilliant act, hint that there have been two distinct sides on the development team. One side that wished to nail the atmosphere and create a living (well, sort of) world, and one side that wished to make Borderlands with zombies. One of the instances in question I encountered very early in the game, when a young man was sitting in blood-red pool, surrounded by bodies, sobbing over one of them. He was muttering something about him being sorry about it and not knowing what to do, and was practically oblivious to my presence. A poignant and important moment, which sadly was diminished by me, moments later, being “rewarded” with a slow-motion scene of a zombie’s head literally exploding, after I directed a particularly powerful blow to its head. This is a complete contrast to the former moment, when it was made abundantly clear that the zombies I’m fighting were once people, and not just mindless husks. Naturally, if I wished to survive I would have to kill hundreds of the undead, and do so without flinching. But it seems odd to me that any survivor would take pleasure in the violence like that, for the whole world to slow down just so one can absorb the glory of the kill. From a purely cynical point of view you, as a survivor during a zombie apocalypse, must kill and move on. You don’t have time for such depravity.</div>
<div><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dead_Island_OhGodOhGodOhGod.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11144" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dead_Island_OhGodOhGodOhGod-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="363" /></a></div>
<div>Of course, judging from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_jNooj48XXA" target="_blank">the marketing campaign</a> it was already quite evident that Dead Island wouldn’t be taking the aforementioned approach to genre, so naturally I attempted to enjoy it for what it was, rather than what I wished it to be. And for a while, I truly enjoyed it. As much as I’ll fight for a game that takes the zombie genre to different, rarely explored places, I have to admit that there’s just something terribly delightful about burying a baseball bat in a zombie’s prefrontal cortex. It’s almost soothing. Do not expect that Dead Island lulls you into a daze, though. When you’re away from the safe houses you encounter in your travels, the snarls of the undead seem ever present, although their source is not always as clearly discerned, allowing you to be horribly surprised when they pat you on the back. Especially the howls of the infected - basically fast zombies - cause spine shivers, as they seem to particularly enjoy sprinting out of the bushes behind you, sinking their teeth into your back. Thankfully their skulls are rather brittle.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Unfortunately, Techland have made so many relatively small blunders when deciding how to build their game, that a thoroughly competent, perhaps even - dare I say it - good game has been reduced to the hellish pits of mediocrity. Firstly, the controls are extremely sluggish, and while this makes sense when you’re swinging a massive axe, it certainly detracts from the experience when your character appears to wait several seconds before swinging his bloody machete. And by then you’ll already be dead.</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>Secondly, the game is marred by a checkpoint system which very rarely works according to plan. Upon death, a certain amount of cash is drawn from your funds and you respawn by the latest checkpoint, free to return to combat again. But when reloading after having quit the game, I occasionally found myself in the middle of an undead horde, which had respawned after I had quit. This resulted in instant death. In general the checkpoint system just seems like a lazy remnant that has been kept over from the console version. I mean, Borderlands had a system that allowed the players, even in co-op sessions, to save their games whenever they wished, so why couldn’t Dead Island do that too? The checkpoint system didn't need to have been a hindrance for enjoyment, but because of various minor technical blunders, such as odd hit detection, it quickly became an unnecessary annoyance. For a game that has been made with co-op in mind, farting around ought not be punished like that. Why should I get a fine for having fun? Again, the two design "wings", if you will, appear again. One side wished to make a game that needed caution from the player, and the other wanted flying limbs and fast cars.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Thirdly, the game is mostly constructed in a linear way. Now, linearity is not much of a problem, quite on the contrary for a game that wishes to tell a tight story, but with the emphasis Dead Island tries to put on pure goofing around with machetes and pointy sticks, beating down the undead hordes, it seems like the game would have benefited from a far more non-linear structure that allowed exploration. That's not to say that the game isn't expansive. Banoi is a very large island, but it never feels like you're allowed to go off completely on your own, due in part to the game's acts taking place in specific game areas. While in these game areas, you're free to explore as you see fit, but the game often puts constraints on how you're allowed to travel, sometimes outright placing invisible walls.</div>
<div>

[caption id="attachment_11145" align="aligncenter" width="620" caption="Moments like these are few in the game, but poignant."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dead_Island_Sorrow.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11145" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dead_Island_Sorrow.jpg" alt="Moments like these are few in the game, but poignant." width="620" height="350" /></a>[/caption]

</div>
<div>The game is mostly non-linear in the first act of the game, one reason why the game is brilliant as I deemed it earlier, and there are multiple routes and paths to explore, some that don’t even lead anywhere in particular. But as the game progresses, the linearity increases, and especially in the last two acts the game several times, through the appliance of unexplainable locked gates and the likes, forces the player to take the path the designers intended for them.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Another point where this dastardly designer intervention becomes evident is in the escort missions that some dimwit at Techland decided should be crammed into the game by the bucket-load. Mostly they are merely annoying, sometimes agonizing, but in one particular main quest mission the game decides to show that it has absolutely no faith in the players' ability to find their own path. One might be overwhelmed by all the choices! That particular mission involves having to escort a native woman along an undead-infested jungle path to a hidden lab. Thing is, there was a driveable car nearby, and a road that could take us directly to the lab, although we’d have to run over some zombies, but who doesn’t like a bit of zombie blood on the windshield? But no, I could not exert any idea of mine over this stubborn woman, and was forced by the game to take the long, arduous path. And tragically, there were no actual revelations made during the journey that the designers could not have inserted elsewhere.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>In addition, there are just some things that feel completely out of place in the game, most notably the special zombies, which the player is never given any information about. Why exactly do giant fat zombies float around in the water, spitting acid at me? Why are half a dozen straitjacket-wearing giant zombies placed evenly all around the city of Moresby? Personally, I quite like it when a game does not smear every little detail about the background of the game in your face, but I would have liked at least some background to why these oddly similar-looking beings have appeared instead of regular infected. As it is now, it just seems like the developers thought they needed to insert some cooler enemies to make the combat more entertaining, rather than ensuring it actually made sense in the Dead Island universe.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Also, there's a weird incongruity in how the missions are presented. There's almost a persistent urgent tone when other survivors ask you to do things, but there are never any consequences if I do not do them. I could run around Banoi for hundreds, thousands of hours without doing anything for the survivors. And yet they'd still be fine. I think Techland tried to avoid repeating the same mistake Dead Rising made with their timed missions, which usually became far too stressful to be enjoyable. But Dead Island creates another problem. Why should I feel anything for some survivors who are not really in need? Who'll get on just fine no matter if I help them or not.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>And oddly no one ever mentions that these are zombies, despite the absurd amount of films and litterature about them that have been produced. I mean, does anyone really not know that you’re supposed to aim for the head? Come on!</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Also, a word of advice for you, dear reader. Do not buy Dead Island for the single-player experience. It’s a shallow, dull and far too long experience that outstays its welcome and discards all the positive things about it after just a few hours. But do buy it for the co-op. Despite all the negative things I have said about the game, the few moments of co-op play I experienced were quite entertaining, and when playing it together with some fun people, slaughtering the undead, I’m sure many of the flaws can be negated. But it still annoys me somewhat that Techland doesn’t seem to have put any particular effort into the single-player. Everything seems to be aimed at co-op play, which I enjoy myself, but I’m just of the firm belief that some things must be experienced alone lest their importance is diminished.</div>
<div>

In essence, Dead Island is a game that doesn't know which leg it wants to stand on. I think the first act embodied what is wrong with Dead Island and all that could have been so good. The first act managed to be enjoyable as the novelty of the combat, albeit sluggish, the eerie atmosphere, somewhat open approach to the world construction and merciless destruction of this holiday paradise all manage to suck you in. All of these things are either slowly peeled away in the following chapters, or become so mundane that it becomes a chore. If the game had tried to build an emotional attachment to the denizens of Banoi, then it might have been endurable.</div>
<div>
But hey, unlike Borderlands, Dead Island actually has an ending. That’s gotta count for something, right?

But to answer your question, the multiplayer is more comparable to Borderlands (the entire game is, really), so if enjoyed that in co-op, you should try it out.";s:11:"POST_submit";s:6:"Submit";s:20:"POST_comment_post_ID";s:5:"11140";s:19:"POST_comment_parent";s:4:"2943";s:26:"POST_akismet_comment_nonce";s:10:"bc787893d6";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"TnrJf826rBQAAFCmAmQAAABF";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:21:"/wp-comments-post.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:45:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-comments-post.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:10:"2003861532";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:3:"892";s:18:"HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL";s:9:"max-age=0";s:11:"HTTP_ORIGIN";s:24:"http://nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:99:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/14.0.835.186 Safari/535.1";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:33:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:63:"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:85:"http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/to-live-and-die-in-banoi-a-dead-island-review-11140/";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:17:"gzip,deflate,sdch";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-US,en;q=0.8";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ruins_Game.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ruins_Game.jpg" alt="" title="Ruins_Game" width="460" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11156" /></a>

Jake Elliot's games have <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/05/interview-jake-elliott-of-cardboard-computer-4028/">always presented a strong emphasis on nonlinear narrative</a>, and it's precisely that elusive quality that's made me appreciate them so much.  His two previous works, <em>Last Tuesday</em> and <em>Balloon Diaspora</em>, both addressed alienation, the feeling of loneliness so prevalent in the work of modern artists.  This new story, <em>Ruins</em>, is about that, but it's also about some other, more tangible things.  It's also, at heart, a game, a game about choices.

Bearing much in common with <em>Last Tuesday</em>, <em>Ruins </em>reads, in development terms, like a treatise on the modern choice mechanic so common in games.  Rather than provide the simple, delineated trees of games like Mass Effect 2, Ruins allows the player to experience a situation and to determine their memory of past events.  It's through this memory that the story will be told, and different events will take increasing prevalence.

Rather than focus on the whats and whys of the story, <a href="http://cardboardcomputer.com/games/ruins/">which are best told to you by the game itself,</a> I want to look at the choices you make as the "protagonist", a shadowy dog, chasing rabbits.  Most choices in the game give you two options (via talking with the "rabbits"), and they are usually major, life-altering choices, which serve to recast the player's role in relation to the other characters in the piece.  In many ways, this is interactive fiction, with the player making choices that effect the story being told him.

Play through the game a number of times, like I did, and you'll find many nesting plot lines, each of which is explored by making different choices.  You feel a sense of agency even though you don't particularly know what you have this sense about: the consequences are obscured when you decide, making it like picking out shapes through a heavy fog.  You're looking at the ruins of a story, the bare bones laid bare in the foggy wood that acts as the game's setting.  Your choices cast the beams which have remained.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ruins_Game2.jpg"><img src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ruins_Game2.jpg" alt="" title="Ruins_Game2" width="450" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11157" /></a>

And bear no doubts, the choices you make will have significant effects on the story you are told.  Every time I've played it, the story was markedly different.  The same basic story was told, but I noticed different things, followed different paths; the characters fixated on different events in their lives.  It's a really fascinating way to tell a story, and that's what <em>Ruins</em> is most interested in: using the narrative potential of gaming to tell a better story, tuned to the player's interests as an individual.

As a story, Ruins is worth playing, because it shows what potential games have for telling honest, mature stories.  The narrative emerges slowly, from different sources (the bunnies), and it will expose itself at your pace, which makes it that much more gripping.  As a game, it is honest and involving, and it shows us what player agency can do to bring us into works we normally would not be thrilled to experience.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Square Enix has revealed <em>two</em> stunning trailers showcasing the highly anticipated <em>Final Fantasy XIII-2</em>, allowing fans of the series to catch a glimpse of what they can expect to find in January 2012. The story will take place three years after the events of <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> and will follow Serah and newcomer Noel in a quest to find the missing warrior Lighting. Players will be reintroduced to the familiar faces of Snow, Vanille (no longer a 9,000 foot crystal), and a much older Hope. Missing from the videos are Fang, Sazh, and the tiny Chocobo that lives in his afro.

Whether or not you shed a tear during the heartfelt footage set to Charice's song <em>New World</em>, fans of <em>XIII</em> will find an abundance of clues in these trailers revealing the fates of their favorite characters. Snow will finally take off his winter hat, Hope becomes the first Final Fantasy character to wear a tie clip, Lightning gets some sweet new armor, and Noel continues the long tradition of somebody being unnecessarily mad at Snow.

Loyal fans of the series were somewhat dismayed at the linear approach Square Enix choose to implement in the first half of <em>XIII</em> and it seems as if the developers took notice. Not only is the sequel promised to deliver a more open world environment, but the heroes will be able to utilize time travel to expand their adventures even further. The new trailer <em>Despair</em> shows us that alternate timelines will open a can of worms for Serah and friends by angering Kaias, an immortal warrior intent on ending your time traveling fun to prevent potential paradoxes. The time gate mechanic being used is known as the Historia Crux and is central to <em>XIII-2'</em>s gameplay and story.

Director Motoma Toriyama explains, "Time paradoxes affect different areas of the world in different ways. In the Bresha Ruins area, a time paradox has caused an enemy called Atlas to appear. The way you figure out how the paradoxes have affected each area is set up somewhat like a mystery."

&nbsp;

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/final-fantasy-xii-2-features-time-travel-in-new-trailers-11167/1_0/" rel="attachment wp-att-11179"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11179" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1_0-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

To further separate themselves from being labeled "linear," Square Enix has made sure that player decisions will determine different outcomes later in the story. Multiple endings have been confirmed and will offer an incentive to replay the campaign with different results.

The universally praised paradigm system will be returning with some expansions. Not only will you be able to fight with two other companions, but monsters can join your party for the first time. Square Enix has revealed that there are over two hundred monsters (including chocobos) that are capable of aiding you in battle. Each of these creatures can be leveled up and customized. The game will also feature randomly placed quick time events that will allow your fighters to gain the edge in battle if the right buttons are pressed in the allotted time.

New to the combat system is the concept of Blood Damage. "Each time you're hit with blood damage, you lose a portion of your max HP. In the first FFXIII, if you had a healer in your party you could recover from damage without trouble. But in XIII-2, you can't recover from blood damage, so you have to defeat enemies quickly."

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/final-fantasy-xii-2-features-time-travel-in-new-trailers-11167/attachment/1/" rel="attachment wp-att-11178"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11178" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

For those of you that were saddened by the lack of Moogles in <em>FFXIII</em>, you'll be encouraged to hear that they will be returning to the sequel in a vital role. The pink nosed creature will be aiding Serah by turning into a handheld weapon, a clock that determines advantages in battle, and a handy treasure finder.

Final Fantasy XIII-2 will incorporate downloadable content in the form of new monsters, equipment and alternate costumes which are rumored to be first available through pre-orders. I would pay a little extra for every character to be able to learn Haste early on so that I was not handcuffed to Sazh again for the first eight hours but I doubt that will appeal to Gamestop as a suitable pre-order incentive.

Square Enix continues to evolve the Final Fantasy series into something that can be enjoyed along a broader spectrum of gamers, following the path of hybrid RPGs such as <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Dragon Age</em>. By adding exciting elements to the combat systems of their traditional RPG format and making the game available to XBOX and PS3 users, the company hopes to reach new fans while retaining their loyal base.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/u_s__supreme_court_11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11202" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/u_s__supreme_court_11.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

The specific ruling is the AT&amp;T vs. Concepcion suit. Short version: the case concerned a cell phone contract that prohibited plaintiffs who had a dispute with AT&amp;T from bringing class action lawsuits against them, or joining a group of plaintiffs together for one big class-action suit. At least, that's how I understood it. If I got it wrong/misunderstood, feel free to correct me.

PDF of the case: <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-893.pdf">http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-893.pdf</a>

Taken from <a href="//edition.cnn.com/2011/09/21/tech/gaming-gadgets/sony-psn-terms/”">CNN</a>, Sony said:

<em>"The Supreme Court recently ruled in the AT&amp;T case that language like this is enforceable. The updated language in the TOS is designed to benefit both the consumer and the company by ensuring that there is adequate time and procedures to resolve disputes."</em>

Basically, all problems will be handled through arbitrators now, who are usually retired judges who go for about $300/hour, with the cost being split between both parties. CNN also points out that arbitration doesn’t involve a jury, which may include people more sympathetic to consumers than corporations. There’s also the fact that they’re just <a href="//www.kintera.org/htmlcontent.asp?cid=71449”">really bad to use</a> if you’re a consumer.

Sony still probably doesn’t have much to go on. Even with the AT&amp;T ruling, and the fact that Sony provides an “opt-out” clause, there’s still the fact that the ruling seemed to be for allowing arbitration only for small amounts of money. There’s also the general legalities of Sony's ToS as well, which many believe is shaky at best since Sony, and others who use ToS agreements, seem to bank on the fact that you won’t, or can’t, read them.

As CNN points out, it takes 45 seconds, using a game controller, to scroll to the part of the document that describes the legal waiver. It takes a minute and a half to scroll through the entire document, and certainly much longer to actually read it. And it’ll take much longer to actually understand it if you’re not a lawyer.

*Spoilers for <em>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</em>, <em>Heavenly Sword</em>, <em>Bioshock</em> and <em>Braid</em>*

Ninja Theory is a studio I really want to like. I really do. They hold a philosophy towards creating games, AAA games at that, I would love to see more of. They create a work and let it stand for itself. There is no extra tie in, no comic book spin offs, and more notable, no sequels. Before modern Hollywood took over (thanks in part to <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Jaws</em>) nothing needed a sequel. A work stood or failed on its own merits and not as a part of a whole. Because of this, a movie was sold more on the talent associated with it or an interesting premise rather than a title that ultimately doesn't mean anything by itself.

Ninja Theory has taken great risks in creating original IPs and then moving on once they were done with the work. <em>Heavenly Sword</em> didn't receive a sequel and really there was no opening for one. Nariko dies at the end and forever is to relive the few days where she commanded the titular weapon. The same goes for <em>Enslaved</em>. The journey is over and while the world may still exist, it might as well be a new IP because with what was set up there is nothing you can really do with it.

Ninja Theory is a studio takes one step forward and two steps back with regards to their games. <em>Heavenly Sword</em> was a game that faltered on hit detection and reasonable fodder enemies, but was otherwise filled with interesting ideas, good boss battles and an interesting story that managed to connect different elements into a compelling and, more importantly, reasonable narrative. <em>Enslaved</em> fixed the hit detection, but simplified the combat and removed the varied interesting set pieces with tired ones that don't seem necessary. <em>Heavenly Sword</em> used a second character to introduce variety into the game. <em>Enslaved</em> has you stick with one character and tried to introduce variety by arbitrarily allowing a new style of play in certain sections. <em>Heavenly Sword</em> was trying to let the player be the main character in a wushu movie. In the game all the over the top actions, colorful boss battles and deified final battle contributed to this goal. <em>Enslaved</em>, however, is an adaptation of a philosophical text on not the nature of subjugation, though it would appear to be that on the surface to a western audience, but instead is a story about learning self-control and personal responsibility. Tripitata, the monk in the original story, isn't the one who places Monkey in bondage and removes that can of worms from the equation right from the start. The gods did that to teach Monkey a lesson, quite literally. The lesson would come organically from the journey. This isn't so much an adaptation as it is taking the character names and the first half of the inside flap summary and working from there.

[Note - Upon editing and double checking the post I found Xuanzang was the name of the monk, Tripitaka is the translated word for the canon of Buddhist scriptures. Later the Chinese form of the word came to be used as an honorary title given to monks who has mastered these scriptures. It has since been erroneously translated as the monk's name, perpetuated by the 1979 TV series that aired in the UK that the developers were more than aware of.]

I liked <em>Heavenly Sword</em>. I did not like <em>Enslaved</em>. I really wanted to, if nothing more than see the potential <em>Heavenly Sword</em> showed Ninja Theory capable of and wanting them to reach those creative heights. Most of my dislike for the new game comes from how utterly stupid it becomes. The story's arc has no real connection to the character arcs. The characters and characterization were the best things about the game. The combat was lazy, the platforming could have not been there and I doubt anyone would have noticed, etc. etc.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-wests-thematic-failure-11212/heavenly-sword-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-11215"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11215" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Heavenly-Sword-1.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="241" /></a></p>
The biggest misstep, however, was the ending. Sparky Clarkson in <a href="http://mwclarkson.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-soon-you-forget.html">his post about it</a> noted the problems that I couldn't point to at the time, I knew there was a problem, but I couldn't voice the nature of it. He articulates it perfectly so I won't rehash his points, but instead say you should go read it because I want to tie them in to the structural problems they are stemmed from.

The title is "<em>Enslaved</em>" and the game in no way deals with the theme of enslavement. This is a white, middle class person, who has never had to deal with the reality of servitude as something as other than working in an office, vision of slavery. Monkey acts like a wage slave rather than the canary in the coal mine he actually is. This is barely servitude, forget enslavement. The demo, which was the first chapter, presented an interesting introduction into the post apocalyptic world of barbarism and slavers. It forged interesting possibilities in my mind of where it could go and what it could say about the subject. It doesn't run away from the themes it promised, instead it hurls them towards the window in an attempt to make them a nice set of curtains and end up tossing them through it. The whole enslavement is nothing more than cleaver window dressing to give a narrative explanation for the usual escort mission trope of mission failure should your ward die. Why? Because it doesn't build to anything or use it in any other way.

The world is devoid of anyone other than Trip and Monkey so the entire game has to rest on their shoulders. Even when Pigsy shows up the spotlight is still firmly centered our two "heroes." The thing is, the direction the developers chose to take them in is not what their premise, nor their title promised. Every work has, at the beginning, what is called the "implicit promise." This is where the work sets itself up, introduces the reader to the work's elements and creates the foundation to which it will build on. Specifically referring to the themes and tone of the work. You don't set up a dark gritty noir drama in the first few pages and then halfway through turn it into a song and dance musical. I can almost hear someone saying, but what about story twists? Something that changes your entire understanding of the work? This is actually where most twists fall into trouble. When a twist betrays everything you knew about a work, then it is a bad twist and shouldn't have been in there in the first place. It's when a creator wants the surprise and shock value that they try to do this, thinking it will be cool. It isn't cool; it's just stupid. If you want to know a good twist that doesn't betray a work's implicit promise, look no further than <em>Bioshock</em> and <em>Braid</em>. <em>Bioshock</em> has one of the biggest twists in gaming where you find out you were being controlled all along, but the very beginning of the game gives you a lecture about self-autonomy. A lecture given by the very man you are forced to kill. Not only does that not betray the implicit promise, it enhances it. <em>Braid</em> has a major twist where you are not the hero, but the villain. You are not a savior, but a stalker. This is the biggest type of twist you can have in a work, but all the writing is centered on setting up a relationship that on reflection looks unhealthy and rather disturbing. The game mechanics are far more analytical and intellectual than they are emotional, which contrasts nicely with emotional nature of the relationship described, so it is shocking, but not a betrayal that the relationship is fake, broken or unhealthy. It makes perfect sense.

Now we come to <em>Enslaved</em>'s twist. The more I think about it the more I think the title refers to those in the VR suits and not the servitude Monkey is put under. Once again this is a more technical way of arguing what Sparky Clarkson argued in his own post. The end result of the analysis is the same however: it's plain stupid. The game isn't stupid in its logical progression of events (i.e. plot); instead it's stupid because that's not what we were promised. A story about enslavement concerning Monkey and Trip, not a story about enslavement concerning the nameless, faceless horde of people who only show up in the unplayable epilogue.
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-wests-thematic-failure-11212/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-11216"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11216" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Enslaved-Odyssey-to-the-West-2.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="346" /></a></p>
I finished the game a while ago and the more I think on it the more I realized there was more to it than story problems. The bigger thing that irked me was how utterly bad the mechanics were in relation to the whole. They were light and weak in their own right, but entered a whole other dimension of bad when regarded in relation to the whole. The combat, for the most part, was very one note and rather repetitive. That itself is not an issue, but then the game became more focused on the combat that it had any right to be. The combat had next to nothing to do with the themes other than basic survival. As something among many different things to do it was fine and it supported the barbaric and uncivilized nature of Monkey, but in focusing on it he becomes less slave than a warrior. It also highlights Trip's weakness even further. She doesn't take charge in the fight by ordering him around. It is the other way around. In combat, he is far more deterministic of his destiny than the title 'slave' should ever grant him.

What the game is saying is 'a powerful, forward thinking, crafty individual is best enslaved, because such an individual would never think of escaping slavery.' Read that sentence again, this time out loud. How does it sound? It sounds stupid, right? And it isn't because of my poor writing skills. That is what Ninja Theory is saying with this game. The thematic message they are conveying for about two-thirds of the game is that convoluted mess. Even <em>Call of Duty</em>, as stupid as the story of those games are, at least it is consistent. We're the good guys, they're the evil dudes, shoot the evil dudes. The details don't matter at this level, because the core at least is consistent. It's hard not to be with such a simple sentiment. Then you have the overly convoluted stories that are bad, see <em>Bayonetta</em>. While that game fall apart in all the minute details of its overly complicated plot (forget story or narrative, the plot alone trips me up), the game can be respected at least in its adherence to its themes despite the convoluted details, because while as a whole they make little sense each individual detail supports the satire in its over the top insanity of action and sexual politics. Enslaved is neither simple nor consistent.

The combat in <em>Enslaved</em> they make little sense, especially because the concept is about survival and they introduce the stealth elements. In a world of deadly robots, stealth makes a lot more sense, but it is handled so poorly. You can only sneak past at certain points, it's not easy to do and often not worth the effort to even try. Doubly so when you get experience orbs for fighting and you will need them for the upgrades in the later mandatory fights. This isn't a detail that doesn't make sense, it's the whole game system.

Another theme that the game abandons is the dichotomy and conflict between barbarism and civilization that is standard in frontier literature. What is the apocalypse but another frontier? With Monkey as the obvious allegory to the untamed wild of man's nature and an expression of pure freedom, if his name, physic or attitude weren't enough, a third of the way through we get an <em>Easy Rider</em> homage. Trip is the intelligent one, the civilized one and the enlightened one of the two. We know this because she lives in a village and knows how computers work. (That was sarcasm. Slavery is neither civilized nor enlightened.) It all disappears as soon as you are introduced to the 'order Trip about' mechanic, because there is no conflict left between the two.

A related side note on the apparent uncouth versus civilized nature of the two is their accents. Both are native to New York, with Monkey's originating from the Brooklyn and Trip sounding more like the Upper West Side. It helps the player subconsciously feel this dichotomy because of the accents' tonalities, but if you live in the area it seems like rather potent jab at the two boroughs.

<p style="text-align: left">Additionally, as much as I like him, Pigsy's presence in the story makes less and less sense the more I think about him, as he is the only other living human to show up in the story. There are robot antagonists, but they play more like marionettes or security bots. They are a threat, but there is nothing threatening about them. Even the Dog seems more like it's playing with a new toy and doesn't know its limits than a truly malevolent creature. Either there is a lack of personalities to fill in the void of the game's conflict needs or just one too many people so that it shifts the focus away from the conflict between the two protagonists. Either would have made a more compelling story than the end result. The fact that I was most entertained when Pigsy was on the scene to act as comedic relief and felt the game lacking everywhere else shows that the middle road they chose to walk only worked at the expense of every other character and narrative element.</p>
I'm rather disappointed in <em>Enslaved</em> for all of this. They had a perfect opportunity to explore well-worn themes we've seen in a post apocalyptic setting (and westerns for that matter) in a new, vibrant setting in contrast to the usual brown, gray wasteland. Instead of the gritty by the skin of your teeth survival of the <em>Fallout</em> mythos, there is a genuine opportunity to rebuild civilization in the same way as the original ones came about. It transplants the type of conflict that existed, at least in fiction, from the mythical prehistoric era to a new setting, at least in terms of the existence of modern/slightly futuristic technology and our monuments of a bygone civilization that will have a greater effect on the audience. Again another missed opportunity.

I feel like I have to bring up Christopher G. Williams <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/135493-the-politics-of-submission-the-romance-of-enslaved/">piece over at PopMatters</a>. He brings up a valid and much more positive interpretation of Enslaved than I have. He compares its acquiescence to authority in terms of how other games have commented on it and sees it as a commentary on co-operation, the end result of what control really means and if "enslaved" is really as negative as the term made us think it is. He points out that both characters submit to one another in a shared goal of survival. He does a pretty good reading off many of the textual elements to come up with an interesting theory of mutual submission as a reflection of the gamer/game relationship.

I don't wish to hate on Mr. Williams, but I cannot abide by this reading. Yes, all the supporting evidence is there for his arguments, but much of what I have described above inhibits such themes from coming across. The supporting evidence is there, but such evidence ignores the stumbling of the game along those same lines. Much of which is detailed, again, in Sparky Clarkson's piece.

I'd call the structural failings of the game's story with itself and in relation to the game's mechanics ludonarrative dissonance, but really it isn't. There isn't any dissonance. That would mean that there was some sort of connection between the two elements in game at all, when really it seems the story they wished to tell is at odds with every element of the game and the mechanics act more as a way to move things forward. They are practically independent to anything else in the game. I think single player games can tell a story best through a synthesis of all the elements at their disposal, but <em>Enslaved</em> doesn't seem to know what it wants to do with each individual element. Its cutscenes are a human drama with a dash of romance thrown in, the mechanics are a survivalist drama, the themes are a master and slave and the setting is a frontier mythos. Pigsy's presence and home add a completely different and unrelated dimension to the game. What can you do with all that?]]></content:encoded>

For those unaware of the awesome online features of <em>Dark Souls</em>, players are faced with three options when they are killed. They can attempt to recover their body <em>Diablo</em> style by fighting their way to it with half health, join another player's game and assist them with a boss battle, or invade another player's game and kill him. Japanese gamers who have obtained copies of <em>Dark Souls</em> before its release date due to a retailer error have begun reporting that their game worlds are being invaded by maxed out black phantoms (dead player characters who chose the third option) who proceed to murder them relentlessly.  Namco Bandai has not confirmed these reports as of yet.

It's tragic that people who received the game early by no fault of theirs are basically not able to enjoy the game until its street date, but I get the feeling that this has been going on long before these reports. If I had to guess, <em>From Software</em> has been doing this for a while and we only have heard of it now because pirates generally don't go public with this sort of thing. The debatable motives of piracy aside, I <em>love</em> when game developers screw with pirates. Whether it's <a href="http://www.1up.com/news/arkham-asylum-features-deliberate-glitch">rendering Batman's glide ability useless</a> or <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/12/michael-jackson-vuvuzela/">replacing Michael Jackson's music with vuvuzelas</a>, this stuff cracks me up.

		<title>CD Projekt Red Conference Contains Witcher 2/GoG Goodness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Witcher-22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11251" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Witcher-22.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="355" /></a>

Today, <em>Witcher</em> developer CD Projekt Red hosted its fall conference. In it, they showed off some new features from the upcoming 2.0 patch for <em>Witcher 2</em>, dropped the game’s price, showed it on the 360, and had some good news about <a href="http://www.gog.com/">Good Old Games</a>. GOG is CD Projekt Red's sister company that re-tools older PC games to make them compatible on current operating systems, and sells them for cheap with lots of goodies and no DRM.

CD Projekt Red says that the 2.0 patch for <em>Witcher 2</em> will be as big as the overhaul they gave the first game. With <em>The Witcher</em>, they re-tooled the graphics engine, re-recorded all dialog, added quite a few quests, removed all DRM, and game a smattering of extras like the soundtrack and dev diaries away for free. The 2.0 patch for <em>Witcher 2</em> will contain:

-New tutorial to introduce the game’s various mechanics better.
-New difficulty mode called “dark mode”, which will make the game harder and add a bunch of dark-themed weapons and armor.
-Arena, which is pretty much just that, an arena where you fight wave after wave of enemies and win prizes
-Various under-the-hood tweaks and improvements to the game’s engine.

The patch will be released on September 29th.

Also announced was a price drop for the game. $10 for the US copy, down to $39.99. Of course if you live in UK, Europe, or Australia, the price will also drop for you, respectively by £5.00, €10.00 and $10 AUD. However, they're still offering a <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/news/the_witcher_2_version_2_0_coming_to_gog_com_on_the_29th_and_were_celebrating">'Fair Price Package'</a> to European and Australian customers, who have to pay more than US buyers. What that means is that if you buy <em>Witcher 2</em> from Good Old Games, they give you the difference in price back, to use on the site. They also showed off <em>Witcher 2</em> on the Xbox 360, and announced it would have some goodies on top of including all the stuff the PC version has. The first of which is an intro CGI trailer. They also wanted to make it clear that the game is not a port from the PC, but an “adoption” to the 360.

On top of all the <em>Witcher 2</em> news, CD Projekt Red revealed that GoG is <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/news/help_us_achieve_6_million_downloads_milestone">nearing its six millionth downloaded game</a>. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky person who preforms the six millionth download gets <strong>all</strong> of the site’s games. That's unique download by the way, not re-download of a game you downloaded before. At the sight’s main page, there’s a tracker for the current current amount of downloads, which at the time of this writing is at 5,810,575. As well as giving one lucky person everything on the site, when the counter hits six million, GoG will give away <em>Broken Sword: Shadow of The Templars Director’s Cut</em> for free to everyone for 48 hours.

<strong>And on top of all that</strong>, there’s a <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/news/all_dandd_classics_up_to_60_off_this_weekend_during_our_3rd_birthday_celebration">promo on GoG</a> for all <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> titles. The titles include <em>Baldur’s Gate 1, Baldur’s Gate 2, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard, Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone, Icewind Dale, Icewind Dale 2, Neverwinter Nights: Diamond Edition, Planescape Torment,</em> and <em>The Temple of Elemental Evil</em>. Each game is 20% off, but the more you buy, the higher the percentage off for D&amp;D titles gets. If you buy them all at once, you get 60% off the final price.

So to summarize, <em>Witcher 2</em> gets a price drop, and new patch on September 29th, adding lots of new stuff. On GoG be the 6,000,000th person to download a game you haven't downloaded before and you get every game on the site for free. Everyone else gets a free copy of <em>Broken Sword: Shadow of The Templars Director’s Cut</em>. And all <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> titles are 20% off, and that percentage increases with each D&amp;D game you buy.

That's quite a lot of awesome stuff, if I do say so myself.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The mega team of Cystal Dynamics and Square Enix are a year away from releasing the highly anticipated Tomb Raider reboot yet they have already collected one of the most prestigious awards in their field. 3D World magazine has selected the best of 2011's CG entertainment industry and proclaimed Tomb Raider's "Turning Point" as the pinnacle of video game cinematics.

Karl Stewart, the global brand director for Tomb Raider and director of the award winning trailer<cite></cite>, was thrilled by the recognition of his team's hard work. "The three-minute trailer took over a year to develop, and is the product of a very successful partnership between the Redwood City videogame developer Crystal Dynamics and the Square Enix Visual Works Studios out of Tokyo. To see our collaborative effort recognised as a leader in the video game space is quite an honour."

The gritty reboot showcases a younger Lara Croft tasked with surviving a brutal shipwreck and ends with her bloodied and alone on an ominous island.

Not surprisingly, Crytek picked up the award for their work on Crysis 2. The sequel to the PC blockbuster won best CG graphics of the year and proved to the world that they could bring a visually stunning game to consoles.

<cite></cite>Cevat Yerli, the CEO and founder of Crytek commented on the achievement. "Winning the first CG Award for Crysis 2 in the category of best in-game graphics is an exceptional honour for us, since it rewards the hard work that our team is doing every day to achieve our, admittedly, ambitious goals. With the release of the PC-exclusive Crysis 1 back in 2007, we wanted to push our technology as far as we could. The fact that the game is still, to this day, being used for graphics benchmarks underlines our success in doing so and is the best credit that we can ask for."

The trailer shows New York City in utter chaos as malicious aliens block every avenue of escape.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The insects buzz everywhere around you. The strange croaking of some reptile echoes in the green hell. You clutch your gun, and, squinting, you spy through the dense jungle. Somewhere out there Charlie’s staring back. Chances are you won’t notice him until you’re two feet away from each other. Luck decides who walks away, and who gets to end his miserable existence with a bayonet in his gullet. You curse this place, and whatever officer put you on this mission. What’s the point anyway? What use are we in this hellhole? You hear the distant sound of footsteps. The cracking of branches. The sloshing sound of boots wading through a bog. Now’s your chance. Stay quiet, and keep a straight shot.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Vietcong_Cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11278" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Vietcong_Cover.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="420" /></a>

That’s pretty much what the first Vietcong (2003) felt like. It offered an extremely tense atmosphere on the varied missions that took place mostly in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia. The player took the role of Steve Hawkins, who had been assigned to a Special Forces camp near the Cambodian border as squad leader. Already in the first few minutes of the game’s intro, reality sets in as Hornster, one of your squad mates, tells you the story of what happened to the guy you’re replacing. AK-47 bullet to the skull. Right out of nowhere. Incidentally, the guy you’re replacing is also the main character in the expansion pack, Fist Alpha. So you even have the privilege of being permanently killed in a game.

At the surface, Vietcong might seem like little else than a simple shooter. You are handed a variety of guns in the beginning, given directions to the jungle and told to kill any and all VC you locate. Well, sort of anyway. You always begin at Nui Pek, the camp situated at the top of a hill, where you get assigned to whatever mission your superiors need you to go on. Often the objectives set for the mission would change wildly as you play, as you adapt according to your enemy’s moves. For example, one mission started as a simple patrol, evolved into a search-and-resuce operation, and concluded with the player trudging through the dim and narrow tunnels beneath the surface, which are apt to either kill you or make you go mad.

<p style="text-align: center"></p>
Vietcong 2 (2005), on the other hand, did away with the jungle setting and instead took the combat to the city of Hue during the infamous Tet Offensive. This was a highly unsuccessful decision by developers Pterodon and Illusion Softworks (best known for their Mafia series), as it highlighted the mediocre action parts of the game and removed most of the tension the first game succeeded at creating. In the first game, you had to be extremely careful when wandering through the jungle, as tripwire and explosives had been laid out everywhere. One misstep and your story’s over. Vietcong 2 had its moments of tension too, but too often it relied on repetitive action mechanics that were far inferior what other similar games at the time, like Call of Duty 2, offered. In addition, Vietcong 2 never managed to build the same bond to your squad mates as the first game did. Even though the characters could easily be said to be stereotypical, there was still some welcomed familiarity to it. The six of you went on merry adventures in the mucky jungles of Vietnam again and again, whereas the few regularly appearing characters in Vietcong 2 seemed more like mere ammo and health dispensers.

Another point where Vietcong stood out from its peers was in terms of realism, especially in the portrayal of the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War is a polarizing matter, and possibly one of the first conflicts in modern times where the United States could not withhold that the war was waged on sound moral grounds. Former wars, like World War 2 or the Korean War, all had a clear, powerful aggressor, either Nazi Germany or North Korea, who were a clear threat to both the United States and her allies. The Vietnam War, while still being a war against Communism, was being fought on far murkier terms. The Vietnamese had been fighting the French and Japanese for decades before that, and thus it was far easier for opponents of the war to depict the Americans as aiding the continued colonization of a country, and incidents like the My Lai massacre certainly didn’t help. Coupled with the ease of broadcasting news from Vietnam without distillation almost straight to TV, support of the war declined rapidly. In 1971 only 28% of Americans <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalhistory.uh.edu%2Flearning_history%2Fvietnam%2Fvietnam_pubopinion.cfm" target="_blank">still supported the war</a>.

[caption id="attachment_11277" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="A simple change of setting is all you need to turn an original shooter into a dull one."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Vietcong2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11277 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Vietcong2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>[/caption]

Vietcong capitalized on this being one of the most unpopular wars in modern history, by giving a fairly sober depiction of the war. You and your squad mates are neither portrayed as heroes nor villains, but rather as people who have been sent there to do a job. There are no lofty morals driving you. If you're given an order you might question the judgement power of your officers, but not the deed that needs to be done. Instead of showing you solely the glorious battles and flag-waving, it showed a brief glimpse of a soldier's life outside off the battlegrounds. And that life is oddly mundane and deadly at the same time.  Incidentally, the game ends with an assault on Nui Pek by the Viet Cong, which culminates by it being evacuated of all military personnel and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6CzTfwL7K0M" target="_blank">the base destroyed</a>. All the killing and dying done in the game has been for naught, perhaps further establishing how hopeless the unwinnable war was. You have gained absolutely nothing in the end.

Another point where Vietcong excelled in terms of realism was in its environments. Sure, by today’s standards doesn’t exactly feature flashy graphics or huge, expansive maps, but they were filled with more character so many shooters. For entire minutes at a time (!) you’d be sloshing through rivers and bogs, making slow progress towards your objective, occasionally spotting some VC hiding in the trees, although they often spotted you first. Also, there would often be neat little “treats” for you to find throughout the map, in the form of pictures and other memorabilia dropped by dead enemies. I clearly remember a picture of Stalin standing next to a small kid, followed by Hawkins’ wonderfully dry comment “He probably neck shot the kid afterwards”. Practically the whole cynical feel of the game summed up into one sentence.

[caption id="attachment_11279" align="aligncenter" width="450" caption="Oh, and at one point you crash in the jungle filled with VC. Good times....good times."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Vietcong_Crash.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11279" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Vietcong_Crash.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="338" /></a>[/caption]

Vietcong clearly wasn’t made by a AAA developer, as should be evident by its rather simplistic mechanics and graphics, but it may have allowed them to experiment more with the story than major developers attached to major publishers. It would certainly benefit from a visual makeover, which could attract a greater crowd, but the depiction of the environments could also improve the chaotic feeling of the green hell. Also, with Pterodon and Illusion Softworks having gained more experience with story-telling, particularly with <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/i-dont-wanna-be-a-hero-2-10064/">the well-crafted Mafia II</a>, oddly enough also featuring characters that couldn't exactly be described as heroic, I can think of few other studios capable of tackling a matter like the Vietnam War. And considering that 2K Czech have made no announcements since Mafia II's release, I, for one, am rubbing my hands in anticipation for an extremely hypothetical Vietcong 3.

So imagine a Vietcong 3 with the same narrative approach to the portrayal of the Vietnam War coupled with the technology of modern day shooters. Would it make money? It's doubtful. After all, it's predecessors are sadly fairly obscure, as Vietcong wasn’t always a game for the trigger-happy people. It required patience and observance. You step into the enemy’s line of fire, you’re gone. Just like in reality.

Despite having it's release date pushed back earlier this year and being a no-show at 2011's TGS, rare news has surfaced about <em>The Last Guardian</em>. Featured on the <em>Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus HD Collection </em>is a round table discussion with the developers including the game's director, Fumito Ueda.

He says about the game, "<em>As much as possible, the level design shouldn't seem too functional or rational. It has to seem like a natural part of the atmosphere and the world, like it's been like that forever. Obviously we need to do the level design, but we don't want our users to notice the intent of the designer... I think that's what we're spending most of our time on right now. I think being unpredictable, giving the game unpredictability, is key for The Last Guardian. Just by their presence alone, the AI characters tend to invite unpredictable situations. That was on purpose.</em>"

Given Team Ico's penchant for designing worlds that truly feel alive, it should come as no surprise that they are taking cues from their previous work to craft a natural environment. However, unpredictability is the key word here, and it'll certainly be interesting to see what surprises Ueda has in store for us once <em>The Last Guardian</em> finally ships next year.

You’ve probably been waiting a long time for this, so I’ll just say it. The release date has been scheduled for December 20th, 2011 for the US, and December 22nd, 2011 for Europe.

Speaking at the 2011 Eurogamer Expo in London, England to a room full fans and press alike, Bioware also announced the pricing model(s) for the game. When you buy the game, you’ll be given the first month free, then can renew with one of the following subscriptions:

-1 Month Subscription: $14.99 (£8.99/€12.99)
-3 Month Subscription: $13.99 per month (one-time charge of $41.97/£25.17/€35.97)
-6 Month Subscription: $12.99 per month (one-time charge of $77.94/£46.14/€65.94)

So there it is. The game finally has a release date, and pricing model.

&nbsp;

To be honest though, I’m kind of sad that <em>The Old Republic</em> is coming out in 2011. With <em>Skyrim, Saints Row 3, Uncharted 3, Batman: Arkham City,</em> and <em>Battlefield 3</em>, I won’t have the time, or money, to play it for a while.

But, for those who do have the time/money,  I’m sure that this is great news.

There are a few things about the handling of <em>Battlefield 3</em> that are troubling - Origin exclusivity and the Online Pass come to mind - but DICE can't be faulted for their new engine, which looks to be as cutting edge as edges get. The Swedish developer's general manager Karl Magnus spoke at the Eurogamer Expo this week about what Frostbite 2.0 will deliver.

Magnus admitted that the company's obsessed with visuals, but they don't want to settle on being able to produce an amazingly detailed frame for a screenshot - they want to have depict the most realistic animation possible. They felt the animation in<em> Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em> wasn't up to scratch, so they searched for the best animation engine they could find.

"We were surprised and happy to discover that it was in the EA Sports games.

"So we worked with the sports team, we worked with a group within EA called EA Tech, and we implemented the ANT animation system into Frostbite 2 – we're the first FPS to be using this animation technology, and for us, it's a big, big difference; how the soldiers move, how they go into cover, how they look under suppressing fire … it really takes you out of the uncanny valley."

The Frostbite engine which powers <em>Battlefield 3</em> first appeared in 2008's <em>Battlefield: Bad Company</em>. Frostbite 1.5 powered its sequel, as well as <em>Battlefield 1943</em> and the multiplayer component of the latest <em>Medal of Honor</em>.<em> Battlefield 3</em> will be the first game powered by Frostbite 2.0, followed by <em>Need for Speed: The Run</em> in November.

Magnus also spoke of the game's audio, which was one of the most immersive features of<em> Bad Company 2</em>. He argues that sound is an integral and often overlooked part of the experience, and to ensure it was done right, DICE sent their sound team to military exercises around the world to capture the sound.

""I'm going to be a bit cocky here and say that I believe a lot of developers overlook this area. I play games every now and then that impress the hell out of me visually, but when you fire a gun it's like, 'ping', 'pooooo.'

"If you've ever been to a range and fired a gun, it's one of the most visceral experiences you can have, it's so fricking loud! We see this game as a very physical experience and when you play it through your 5.1 system, I would say audio makes up 50% of that experience."

<em>Battlefield 3</em> hits American shores on October 25, Europe on the 27th and Australia the 28th. The <a title="Battlefield 3 open beta" href="http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3/1/beta" target="_blank">open beta</a> starts on the 27th of this month if you've pre-ordered the game through Origin, and the 29th for everyone else.

Games have changed a lot over the past few years.  And I’m not just talking about that whole motion controls Kinect bullshit.  I’m still hoping that fad fizzles out fairly soon.  No, the change I’m talking about is certainly more subtle than that, though if you ask me it’s no less fundamental.

Come with me, if you will, on a trip back to 1999.  Your Nintendo 64 or Playstation or hell, maybe even Dreamcast collection is the envy of all the other neighborhood kids - you have a game for every occasion.  If you want to play an adventure game, you play <em>Mario</em> or <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>.  If you’re in the mood for some action, <em>Goldeneye 007</em> or <em>Doom</em> are there waiting for you.  If RPGs are your thing, you have <em>Final Fantasy</em> or<em> Baldur’s Gate</em>.  The sports enthusiast in you can turn to <em>Madden</em>, <em>Need for Speed</em>, or <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>.  I could surely go on<em> ad nauseum</em> but I’m sure you see what I’m saying - games had genres.  Categories that they fit into. It helped me as a misguided 13 year old know what the hell I was buying when I picked up that copy of <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> (“Tactical Espionage Action”) in my local Babbage’s.

[caption id="attachment_11337" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="See that? The game&#39;s title literally tells you what genre it is. Ah, the good old days."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mario-RPG.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11337  " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mario-RPG.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="309" /></a>[/caption]

Now, in 2011, things are different.  I play <em>Mass Effect</em> when I want to play an RPG that’s also sort of an action game.  Or maybe it’s an action game that has some RPG elements in it.  <em>Portal</em> is a puzzle game loaded with action.  I think.  <em>Warhawk</em> is a great first person shooter that incorporates some trappings of an RTS.  The line is becoming blurred.  The concept of “genre” is becoming passe.  "RPG elements" are everywhere, whatever that means.

So what happened?  Did developers just get bored?  Tired of adhering to the same old “genre formula,”  did they just decide to try something new? An encouraging thought, to be sure, though even a cursory glance through any current “top selling” list shows that developers have absolutely no problem recycling game formulas over and over again.

My theory is that it’s a combination of factors that happened to come together at the right time.  On the one hand, as games have become exponentially more popular in recent years, the more involved genres like RPG's and RTS's just didn’t hold enough appeal.  In an age where games take several years and millions of dollars to make, if all but 1.6%* of your market are put off by hardcore resource gathering and inventory management, of course you’re going to cut it. After all, what good is a game that nobody plays?
*<em>Not a real figure. Flame shield on.</em>

This happened to coincide on the other side of the coin with the whole “gamification” thing.  In other words, it’s not enough to already be playing a game simply for the enjoyment of playing - now people are demanding to be constantly rewarded just <em>for</em> playing.  Small, ultra-hyberbolized victories are cropping up everywhere.  <em>Everything</em> levels up.  Our football players level up, our cars level up, even our fucking <em>guns</em> level up and they’re inanimate for god’s sake.  The “instant gratification” previously touted by video games isn’t instant enough anymore.  Now we need to see numbers everywhere to track our progress in real time (unrelated side note: how many Twitter followers do <em>you</em> have?)

The chimera resulting from this perfect storm of commerce and mass social boredom is some new sort of eternal middle-ground supergenre.  Or perhaps a more appropriate term is non-genre; a giant, all-encompassing splotch of gray quickly overtaking the otherwise colorful array of games out there.

<em>But isn’t this a good thing, </em>you ask?  <em>Isn’t sticking to genre formulas a potential hindrance to innovation in games?  </em>Absolutely, without question.  I’m not at all saying that we should firmly resist change and insist only only playing paradigm games.  But, what’s important to keep in mind is that these longstanding genres are longstanding for a reason - because they work.  Certain elements and mechanics may seem tedious, outdated, or useless individually, but are vastly important to contributing to the overall feel and experience of a game.  If you start cutting and pasting, adding elements to a game that “seem cool” whilst removing ones that “seem tedious,” you run the same risk as a 6 year old with a self-styled haircut.  Individual pieces may seem to work, but the overall thing as a whole is a mess.

[caption id="attachment_11340" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="Sometimes, when genre elements are mixed, it&#39;s an overwhelming success. Yay, great new games!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mirrors_edge_logo.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11340   " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mirrors_edge_logo.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="309" /></a>[/caption]

To put it another way, the difference between an “action RPG” and an “action game with RPG elements” is that I invest in an RPG.  That character is <em>mine</em>, goddammit, so I’m going to obsess over every piece of armor I equip and every attribute point I assign, and ultimately not even care that I’m essentially doing “work” because I’m connected to the game - I am, if you will, "role playing."  In an action game, even with RPG “leveling” added in, I’m just shooting things, and every now and then I have to stop to assign some skill points or choose a new power.  It takes more than doling out XP to make a game an RPG, especially on the level of connecting to a game through your character.

And frankly speaking, sometimes I <em>want</em> that gruelling tedium offered me by RPG's of old.  Sometimes, I really do want to sit down and spend hours pouring through stat sheets and inventory lists in a way that I can’t when I play one of these “action games” with their supposed “RPG elements.”  Maybe it’s because I was raised on these games but I honest to god enjoy that shit sometimes.  In automatically taking care of all the “under the hood” stuff for me, these games are actually depriving me of the stuff I <em>want</em> to do.  Conversely, sometimes I just want to take a load off and play a game of NHL - just a simple game of hockey, and not have to worry about if my second stringer has decent enough stats to lead my team if my starter happens to get injured in some random event somehow.  Different games fulfill different functions for me; that's why I play so many different games.  Mashing up all the elements to make them all resemble one another is just purpose defeating and frustrating.

[caption id="attachment_11341" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="...And sometimes, when you mix genre elements, it goes very poorly."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dynasty_warriors_6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11341  " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dynasty_warriors_6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="309" /></a>[/caption]

Let me reiterate for those who think I sound overly negative.  Bucking the yoke of the conventional genre should be <strong>encouraged. </strong> We want to see new, innovative games that take us to new places, tell new stories, and push the limits of the medium.  But while games should move on from their classic genre origins, they should never forget them.  Update the games, but preserve the spirit they’re trying to convey.  I promise that if games are pushed in a direction that still encourages true engagement, people will buy them.  And there won’t even be a need to gamify the hell out of it because playing a genuinely well-constructed game is, overwhelmingly, its own reward.  Let’s keep moving forward and, perhaps paradoxically forge some brand new genres. Maybe then gaming’s landscape of gray will start to get a bit more colorful again.

		<title>Direction of Uncharted Heavily Influenced by Xbox Shooters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How close was Nathan Drake to being an elf? An article in the 209th issue of <em>Play</em> revealed that Naughty Dog's original plans for the <em>Uncharted</em> games were much different than the final product. Apparently, the Playstation 3 exclusives were originally meant to be more of a fantasy series that resembled some of Naughty Dog's previous titles (<em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and <em>Jak and Daxter</em>.)

Many gamers will remember the slow start that the Playstation 3 experiences upon its release. The Xbox 360 boasted a huge collection of hit games within the system's first year, casting a large shadow over their Japanese rivals. Wisely, the top brass at Playstation saw the winds of change and strongly urged developers to adopt the "gritty" style of shooters that were drawing fans toward Microsoft. Naughty Dog hesitated at the new direction but ultimately wound up creating the highly praised <em>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</em> and <em>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</em>.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/direction-of-uncharted-heavily-influenced-by-xbox-shooters-11350/uncharted-2-screenshot-shield-gun-fight/" rel="attachment wp-att-11352"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11352" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uncharted-2-screenshot-shield-gun-fight-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a>

Don Poole, a former Environment Modeller, gave the inside scoop of his former company by sharing some of the secrets to their success. "We were talking about a more 'realistic' game in terms of how it was modelled and rendered but the concepts were much more far out. One was a forest world where the antagonists lived underground."

"It had elements of Tolkien in for sure. Sony kept pushing for a more realistic game in all respects. The market had changed a lot by then. The demographic was older and gritty shooters were really dominating. Sony wanted very much to get into that market share, it pushed all of its developers in this direction."

"So the big push from Sony, not just at Naughty Dog but at all of Sony's development companies at the time, was to craft games for PlayStation 3 that were much more realistic. The pressure from Xbox's success with gritty shooters was a very real force on our direction at that time. We had a lot of internal grumbling about the realist bent. More of the old dogs were from the Crash and Jak era and preferred that more whimsical style. But alas, that was a losing battle."

While difficult to imagine the <em>Uncharted</em> games would have catapulted to the same success without Sony's influence, it is intriguing to think what might have been if "the old dogs" had gotten their way.

		<title>Nearly A Third of Players Think the Nintendo 3DS is Better Without the 3D</title>

You would think that most 3DS owners would play the handheld largely for, you know, the 3D part. After all, it's the first gaming device to sell itself on 3D - without glasses, no less - and despite the criticisms hurled against its rushed release and lack of launch titles, it's an impressive technical feat. Yet a recent survey from research firm Interpret LLC found that over a quarter of respondents thought that 3-dimensionality made the handheld <em>worse</em>.

Speaking at the 3D Gaming Summit in California last week, Interpret's Dan Casey revealed that 28% of the 1,600 players who took the survey felt that 3D detracted from the experience, while only 22% thought it improved gameplay. 13% of players used the handheld device with the 3D completely switched off.

Casey also revealed that players much prefer the prospect of an immersive, big-screen TV 3D experience - 56% cited a playable console connected to their television as an ideal 3D experience, while only 7% would prefer handheld 3D gaming.

Awareness for the 3DS was up by 60% - which is kind of a given, seeing as how it wasn't around a year ago - but when there are more people actively avoiding the main selling point of your product than there are people using it, one has to wonder if 3D in games is worth pursing right now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Earthbound.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11362" title="Earthbound" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Earthbound.jpeg" alt="" width="450" height="360" /></a>

If I was forced to make a list of my favorite games, I wouldn't pick Earthbound, but I'd really want to.

Even after sixteen years, Earthbound is the strangest game in my collection. Even its sequel, the incomparable Mother 3, a title that would be my favorite game ever, doesn't quite scratch the same itch. No, what Earthbound has is an abundance of whimsy. In a culture where we have hundreds of fantasy adventures, sci-fi epics, and gritty war dramas, Earthbound is one of the few games that offers us the whimsical modern world of a child.

When I read Harry Potter, I think of Earthbound (and vice versa). Both help us transcend the everyday by making the routine, the mundane, exciting. They both take simple tasks like taking your dog for a walk or making breakfast, and they make them compelling theater by adding elements of the fantastic. They take our world, and they make it strange and new to us.

When I play Final Fantasy, I hear the story of a spiky haired antihero with a massive sword. It's interesting and I love playing games like that, but I, the gamer, am not brought into that world. When I play Earthbound, I begin to feel like everything I do could become an adventure. That bee I saw fluttering past me yesterday afternoon could have been a time traveler from another dimension trying to contact great heroes in the past. I will walk down the street after I am done posting this article and I will marvel at the beauty of creation, because if I followed the river behind my house far enough I bet I could get to Saturn Valley, while strange, androgynous aliens live.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/EARTHBOUND000.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11363" title="EARTHBOUND000" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/EARTHBOUND000.png" alt="" width="450" height="360" /></a>

The concept of whimsy is alive and well in literature, where the best selling books since the Bible are a big, tall glass of whimsy poured into a copper mug, but in video games it is increasingly an emotion designed and manufactured, created from what we thought we'd want to see. Nintendo has made bank on the concept with Mario, a plumber transferred to a magical land, but as technology has advanced, as there has become more room for worlds, places, and ideas in games, he has been moved to a magical fantasy land and become more like a fairy tale for modern times. Super Mario Brothers 2 was the whimsical height of the series: Mario, a normal man, having a dream about fantastic things. The player is brought into the whimsical world. While the world of more recent title Super Mario Sunshine is, no doubt, magical, it does less to bring us in. Mario is a character, and we are not him like we were in the older games. We're not him because now he has thoughts, and he has feelings, and they are not ours. Delfino Isle and the piantas that inhabit it are designed to induce happiness, but they don't bring us into the equation. Mario Sunshine is a story, while Mario 2 was a story we were taking part in.

Other games are less subtle. Titles like <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/04/review-cargo-3876/">Cargo!</a> and Rock of Ages exist solely to scratch the whimsical itch, by placing us in a world that looks like its come out of a bizarre European animation. And they work. They're fun games, and I'm happy they exist. But there's no element of player involvement. They are designed to assault the part of our brain that processes the whimsical (let's call it the hypothalamus, because that's a wonderful word), but it is an unsubtle process. They give us wonderful alternate realities where everything is strange and weird, but when the game is over, we're back in our cold, boring homes, wondering why life is the way it is.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SgCxCZNkQ9E" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
What makes Earthbound different, what makes it transcendent is the attempt at sixteen bit realism, and it amazes me more games have not approached this combination: the realistic with the fantastical. Most games prefer to tell their stories in broad strokes of fantasy or war or what us literature types call “genre” over the idea of building stories in the modern world, placing us in our lives and giving us the chance to see the beauty in the everyday.

Earthbound's legacy, the reason why I love it so, is that it takes modern life and makes it exciting. You go for a walk with your dog at night and you find a meteorite, cordoned off by the police, surrounded by angry animals. You meet a bee who tells you you're destined to save the world, and off you go on a merry adventure into a world quite like ours, but with mystery around every corner. You save a town from ghostly possession. You defeat a creepy, color-themed cult, and you have a magical experience eating “cake”. You find a race of strange, alien creatures living over the hill next to your town, and you befriend them, to the point where they help you travel in time.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/EARTHBOUND003.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11365" title="EARTHBOUND003" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/EARTHBOUND003.png" alt="" width="450" height="360" /></a>

You know, everyday things you wish you could do, but never found the time for when you were a kid.

True whimsy is rarely the goal of games. The Persona series takes a lot of these concepts, and it places the player in the modern world, one where the weird can, and does, happen, but it goes for more of <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/so-long-persona-3-4760/">a dark direction instead of giving us a world of childhood legends.</a> If Earthbound is Harry Potter, then Persona, rather unfortunately, is Twilight: edgy, a little dangerous, and sexy. Earthbound, like J.K. Rowling's breadwinner, is fun, exploratory, and it finds, in its ending, triumph and happiness out of the deepest darkness it can imagine.

That happiness is why I go back to Earthbound. It's a brilliant little game that makes me feel better about myself, about life, about the world around me. While other games attempt darkness, Earthbound gives us the world as we assumed it as children: happy, speckled with darkness but ultimately a lovely, brilliant place where we want to live and grow old. It's why I've grown with Earthbound and why I hope, years from now, I'm still playing through it, appreciating its whimsical world.

Long in the works, Journey is the ambitious upcoming PS3 title by acclaimed indie studio, thatgamecompany. Set in a vast desert with minimalist principles, producer Robin Hunicke has recently discussed many of the team's inspirations, design philosophies, and challenges that have gone into it's creation.

"We're all really inspired by games that make you feel like you're small, like you're in a huge place," she explained. " So we talked about how we could create that feeling of smallness, so a lot of the artwork comes from that place of wanting to create a historical look. So everything in <em>Journey</em> has a reason for being there, it's all architecturally sound, we might build a building then break it, rather than build a broken building.

"Matt really believes that's part of what makes an environment holistic and I think that if you look at Miyazaki films, or the games of Team Ico, or <em>Another World</em>, which people often say they're reminded of when they play <em>Journey</em>, I think the theme that runs through all of these is the feeling of continuity is so strong, like it really feels the world should exist - that it's a real place. It's not gamey, it's not fantasy, it feels like it came completely from someone's mind. That I think has its roots in our understanding that the environment is so important to putting you in a different place. You can't have a different emotional experience if you aren't in a different place. And then just influences in terms of the actual look ranged from Turkish churches to Navajo stuff all the way through deserts."

For those keeping up with the news, you may notice that this sounds incredibly similar to Fumito Ueda's <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/fumito-ueda-says-the-last-guardian-to-be-unpredictable-11290/">own goals of creating a natural environment</a> in one of Sony's other upcoming exclusives, <em>The Last Guardian</em>.

When asked about other environmental influences, Robin responded, "I would say the single most influential thing we did as a team about what <em>Journey</em> should be was we took a team trip to the dunes outside of LA and just ran around the sand for a while. It was crazy awesome.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NlVttFRPpU

"The lead programmer was totally obsessed with the way the sand would fall from the dunes when the wind would blow, how it would get on your clothes. From the very beginning of the project, John Edwards would say, we really need to get that feeling of grit, and expanse, the feeling that it's everywhere, the sand. And we all just got it - 'okay, we're going to do it.' It's a huge chunk of work, but let’s make it happen. I actually have a bunch of sand, and some bones and shells from the dunes in a jar on my desk. Just as a reminder that there is a real place in the world that was so inspiring to us."

The inspiration certainly shows, as highlighted in the video above, as sand sways and blows across the vast desert landscape, showing off the game's beautiful visuals, but what about designing the game itself? The team mentions some of the challenges they were faced with during development.

"We're always talking about what could be next. Not even just for us, just in general if a cool game comes out, we'll send a link around and talk about it. So on that level there's always a dialogue. But Journey specifically was a pretty huge undertaking for us. It has a bipedal character, there's cloth and sand, it's online, there's multiplayer. Its like, when we first started talking about it, we thought  'Sure, yeah you know,' and then later we realized this is going to be a lot more work then we thought. But it's always that way with games.

"I would say it's probably a combination of the intention to design things that create new feelings, and our experience - building on top of the engine, building on top of our knowledge and understanding of what works, and what doesn't work."

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/journey-developers-discuss-game-philosophy-and-relationship-with-sony-11376/thatgamecompany_logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-11403"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11403" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ThatGameCompany_Logo.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Robin also spoke about the company's relationship with Sony and their future development now that their three game exclusivity contract will be over with the release of <em>Journey</em>. While unsure of their future, she reaffirms their strong relationship and the support Sony has given them throughout the years, and how their games embody their continued development as a company.

"We're independent, but they're our publisher. So we signed a three-game deal with them, so <em>flOw</em>,  <em>Flower,</em>  and <em>Journey</em>  will be the three games of that deal. That was actually a fantastic relationship. They were really supportive of TGC growing into a company.

"We started in their offices and then we moved into our own offices eventually. There was a lot of scaffolding, a lot of help from producers, especially through <em>Flower</em> and <em>flOw</em>, just getting the process right. Because everybody that started the company had just graduated, so there wasn't a lot of experience there. So without Sony, I don't know that TGC would exist."

When asked about future projects, she replied, "We have no idea. The answer is that we're just so focused on getting <em>Journey</em> done. It took a lot longer than we thought to make it happen, and we're so close now that the temptation is to think  'Oh it's almost done. Let's daydream about the next project,' but for the most part we're really, really focused on making <em>Journey</em> happen. There will be an announcement about the date soon. We get notes on our Facebook page from our fans saying they're ready for it. It's pretty hard to ignore that stuff - you have to pay attention."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Games today just aren't realistic enough, eh? Why stop at the realistic visuals and settings when we could <em>feel</em> the sting of a bullet in a Modern Warfare match or the whack of blade in The Legend of Zelda? Fortunately, the folks over at the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo are working hard on a new device which may bring our games to the "next level."

The device is meant to simulate the feeling of an object passing through your hand, ultimately meant to "improve the sense of realism in games." Wait, how exactly do you feel something that's not actually happening? It's all thanks to the eerie-sounding "phantom sensation." A phantom sensation occurs "when two points on your skin are stimulated at the same time," and this results in the feeling that "the space between them is being touched."

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyr2-eR2Zi0

The device is currently built with some Wii-remote technology.

I can't be the only one that sees this as completely unnecessary, right?

News from Japan! GREE Inc., the biggest Japanese social network you've never heard of, is reporting that it's shares have now doubled in value, thanks in no small part to the growing demographic of female users attracted to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otome_game">otome genre</a>. And GREE's not the only one seeing big profits. DeNA Co., a mobile games manufacturer, saw share values increase 23%, while Voltage Inc, who specialize in otome games, saw their share values increase by 21%. In fact, profits have grown so dramatically, analysts speculate that the female orientated games could amount to 20 billion yen ($261 million) over the next 5 years.

So why the dramatic increase in demand? Part of it is attributed to the growing social gaming scene in Japan.  However, Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist for the Daiichi Life Research Institute, contributes the growth to women seeking virtual men with traits they desire in the real world. "Dating games became a blockbuster category among women because characters in those games give them what they want from men in the real world." It's interesting to speculate, then, if this is a direct result of Japan's<a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/world/japan.herbivore.men_1_japanese-men-men-and-women-girlfriend?_s=PM:WORLD"> growing "herbivore men" population</a>, but I digress.

The growing demand for such games is expected to have a strong influence on games targeted and marketed to the female demographic on a global level according to Tomoaki Kawasaki, analyst for Cosmo Securities Co. One can only hope this has a positive influence in our field of entertainment, as the female demographic has long been neglected in western gaming.

		<title>Skyrim Could End Up on the WiiU</title>

One of the few things Nintendo has confirmed about the WiiU is that the system will have plenty of third party support. According to Nintendo Magazine, <em>Skyrim </em>could be joining <em>Darksiders 2</em>, <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>, and many other games that will have been out for months by the time the WiiU launches.

"The more changes we have to make to a game the less and less palatable it becomes because making a game is an enormous process. Just doing 360, PS3 and PC - I don't think people understand the amount of work that goes into that. All of the localisation you have to do... all of the testing you have to do... on every platform in every language... It's a pretty huge undertaking," says Pete Hines of Bethesda.

With that in mind, I don't think we'll be expecting any WiiU-specific features like a spell that let's another player use the system's unique controller to play as a dragon with his own screen or something.

<a href="http://www.krautscape.net/index.php">Krautscape looks like the racing game from my dreams</a>, the one where the path pops up right in front of me like a rainbow. And look at this story. This is the hot shit, man:
<blockquote>Around 1880, the world renowned german inventor Dr. Konrad von Krautkopf developed a machine, which could not only drive at enormous speeds, it could also fly. He called them Krautomobiles (or Krautos). As he couldn‘t find a way to keep these machines working within our known laws of physics, he attempted to create a system which gave the Krautos a opportunity to operate outside of the usual cobble-stoned roads being used back in the 19th century. He called this system „The Krautscape“. Due to his obstinate character, he never told anyone, apart from his best friend Carl Benz. In the „Krautscape“, with simple control-mechanisms, Krautos can control the street by directing the way it is built, in order to help them reach their goal in the quickest time possible. For a Krauto, to affect the curve of the street, it simply would have to drive on the edge of it whilst driving through the street-building gate. Dr. von Krautkopf imagined this system as a flexible alternative for common modes of transport and also for special events like races, where it would create a racetrack.</blockquote>
I know, only sick and strange people care about story in racing or fighting games, but this seems like a game created by the sick and strange. In its essence, the game seems like a delicious mixture of Audiosurf, F-Zero, and those devilishly twisted moments in Mario Kart 64 where you jumped off of Rainbow Road only to land further ahead on the track, way ahead of your opponents.

It's basically Rainbow Road the game, except instead of you having to carefully plot your jumps, you're in a weird half car, half plane hovercraft that can fly across the level. Oh, and the person in first creates the track in front of them based off their position, allowing them drive the track away from would be flying passers.

This all looks glorious, in other words. No word on a release date yet ("before June 2051", the developer kindly hints in the comments to the below video. Thanks, guv!) but it's in development for PC and Mac. <a href="http://www.krautscape.net/index.php">Here's their site again</a>, and here it is in glorious motion:

A Japanese publisher/developer that actually wants to distribute games on the Xbox 360 and PC? You heard right! Nippon Ichi Software, best known for the <em>Disgaea</em> series, is making their latest game available on Xbox 360 and through Steam. <em>Clan of Champions</em> (<em>Gladiator Versus</em> in Japan) is a fighting game in which up to four players can duke it out in an arena playing as fantasy favorites like elves, orcs, and us puny humans.

"Yes, this will be our first Xbox 360 game. Right now, it’s our only title for Xbox 360," said Haru Akenaga, President of NIS America, in an interview with Siliconera. "We had some plans to release titles for the Xbox 360, but considering the Japanese market some developers gave up on releasing Xbox 360 versions. With this title [<em>Clan of Champions</em>] we analyzed the U.S. market and the best market for this kind of title. Because of that we decided we should release it for Xbox 360."

We Americans do like our violence. I wonder if they considered the fact that this game in no way includes Russel Crowe? Either way depite the possible dire consequences, I'm more than happy to embrace more Japanese games on predominantly American platforms.

<em>Elder Scrolls</em> games are among the elite role-playing experiences out there that actually require some preproduction work if you don't plan on spending five hours in the character creation screen. <em>Skyrim</em> is no exception, but thankfully a list of the game's perks and racial abilities has hit the internet for your preplanning pleasure. So what kind of character will you be? Although I find the idea of a suave, smooth-talking orc to be hilarious, I'm going to be rocking an Imperial as per my obligation to represent us "puny" humans in fantasy games. <strong>

		<title>Naughty Dog Dishes on Storytelling and Uncharted 4</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <em>Uncharted</em> series has mesmerized gamers with its exceptional graphics, precise gameplay, and innovative environmental interactions but what really sets it apart from the average shooter is its ability to tell a great story. Naughty Dog's focus on weaving history with legend has created a winning formula that <em>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</em> has every intention of continuing.

The Guardian nabbed a recent interview with<em> Uncharted 3's</em> co-lead designer Richard Lemarchand and he provided some insight to the team's story telling method. "We realised fairly early on something that the writers of science fiction and fantasy always say: it's important, when you're telling a fantastical story, to ground it. Enough of the story has to be comprised of recognisable nuts and bolts reality so that the audience has something to grab on to during the tale."

Although both Uncharted games have added a touch of the supernatural, the developers stressed that players are more hesitant to take that leap of faith without first implementing an environment set in the real world.

"We knew we had a great opportunity to do something that often gets overlooked; we wanted to make a game that, through the mechanism of being set in recognisable reality, could occasionally pull a mystery or some fantastical element out of the bag and it would have so much more potency as a result."

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/naughty-dog-dishes-on-storytelling-and-uncharted-4-11504/smurfmen-article_image/" rel="attachment wp-att-11516"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11516" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/smurfmen-article_image-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

One of the most interesting questions asked during the interview implied that Naughty Dog has more adventures in store for Nathan Drake.

<strong>"And you said during your talk that Amy has this huge library where she looks up real-life legends and myths that may well work in Uncharted titles. Do you think she has a list of unused examples ready for Uncharted 4, 5 and 6…</strong>
(Laughs) She just has an amazing brain, she has a real thirst for knowledge and we can sit there for hours jawing about history, and geography and… yeah, there's a lot left in there!"

It is hard to imagine Sony and Naughty Dog ending such a profitable franchise after <em>Deception</em> but fans of Uncharted should be encouraged that the developers have not yet emptied their bag of tricks.

As far as guest characters go, the silent protagonist of the <em>Half Life</em> series seems like the least likely to show up anywhere, least of all in the Steam release of top-down destruction racer <em>Renegade Ops</em>. Either way, here he is! He even shoots antlions! This is better than news of any new <em>Half Life </em>games, right?

<em>Renegade Ops</em> releases on Steam October 14th.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love weird things. The absurd and the surreal are always welcome additions to my life, and I tend to gravitate towards these things. Bizarre speculative fiction worlds filled with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perdido-Street-Station-China-Mieville/dp/0345459407/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317087683&amp;sr=8-1">trans-humanism</a> and rich histories involving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Saints-Madmen-Jeff-Vandermeer/dp/0553383574/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317087696&amp;sr=8-1">mushroom people</a> and fungus based science are the basis to some of my favorite books. My favorite moments in games are non-moments for most people, little nods toward a larger unspoken world, like the creepy watchers in that one world of <a href="http://www.mariopartylegacy.com/forum/index.php?topic=3180.0">Mario Galaxy 2</a>.

So of course <em>E.Y.E.</em> caught my... eye. It's a blend of steam punk, cyber punk, and a dystopian future all wrapped up in an FPS/RPG hybrid with multiple solutions to problems. How could I resist? I had my fond memories of <em>Deus Ex</em> to fuel the fire, and by the time I started the game I was excited for the experience. The entire game was summed up for me in character creation, not that I knew this at the time. You are presented with an assortment of skill modifiers, none of which are explained to you in anyway. So, with no understanding of how it will impact the game, you spend your points and build your character. I can tell you now that each stat determines how powerful or effective various powers and abilities will be, including those researched or acquired later on. I also know, by cheating and reading the wiki, that where you spend points affects some powers you are granted by, essentially, determining your characters class.

[caption id="attachment_11532" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="So... Many... Things..."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00006.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-11532 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00006-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

Despite the confusing process of making my character, I figured it would all come together with time. After all, I would just level and spend points later on as I learned more. I jumped in feet first hoping for a strange and interesting story to drive me through this world. Hours later and I could certainly confirm the strange part. Otherwise I had no idea what the hell was going on.

This is a realized world with terms and rules all its own, so as everyone talks about the different factions and “the metastreumonic force” it can all get a bit overwhelming. That metastreumonic force, by the way, is apparently causing strange monsters to appear in the world that like to kill and eat everything, although the hows and the whys behind this are a bit cloudy for me. All I know is that I learned how to make one explode out of an enemy's chest for fun. To make matters worse, the translation then comes along and ensures this won’t be an easy to follow thread. It's rough, to say the least, with plenty of awkward phrasing and odd word choices. I will be totally honest with you, I had no idea what was happening most of the time. To be really honest with you, I still don’t.

“Well, I may not understand anything that’s happening in this world,” I thought, “and have no idea what motivates these people, but I still have gameplay to look forward to!” So I plowed forward, resolute to hack stuff and approach situations in unique ways. Like a filthy and murky wishing well, the experience is clouded with frustration speckled with brief shining moments of brilliance. Except not so much brilliance, more just some pocket change with patchy algae growth.

One such patch is player choice, at least I think it is. See, the game has a sort of permadeath system in place. When you die, your character is resurrected through some system that exists in the world. This is paired with an autosave function and no quicksave. Basically, if you do something or make a choice in the game, you are married to that choice. I’m pretty sure that choices I have made through dialogues with various characters have impacted how levels, and the game, have progressed. I just can’t load a previous instance to compare the choices to know just how significant these choices and changes were. I love this because it makes these choices matter. Every other game I can load and save constantly and in doing so remove all meaning from the choices. The only problem is that in EYE, most of of the choices were all about things that still don’t make any god damned sense to me. Still, it feels awesome to have to own up to the choices you make and how they shape how a level will play out.

The levels are all massive and sprawling, often existing as empty and dilapidated city blocks for me to get lost in. I’ll bumble my way through encounters to reach objectives, then get told to head back again and somehow get lost returning from where I came. This process is repeated until a screen pops up letting me know I finished the mission, and really makes sure I know I finished the mission by crashing to my desktop. That last part is the most frustrating of the bugs present in the game, but it seems like its at least rare for someone to encounter it with my frequency. Overall level design is a series of massive spaces bathed in the grey/brown palette with plenty of murky fog on the edges. Getting lost is inevitable, but it does make bumping into baddies a bit more exciting this way, and bumping into enemies is when you get to bust out all the various abilities and powers that make this game so interesting.

Choice is really what this game is all about, and it's also what is responsible for every shining moment you will experience. When you create your character, it has nothing to do with looks, like I mentioned earlier its all about the modifiers that will impact your play style. It's about the choices you make in the levels that impact how those maps play out and how faction alliances shift throughout the experience. But it's how you level up that will determine the meat of the experience.

You have access to CyberTech, which are cybernetic enhancements or straight up replacements of organic bits, like a shiny new CyberBrain. Once you install one of these enhancements you can upgrade these at anytime by spending money on them, which in turn raises their levels. These additions to your body improve and alter your play style in various ways. Want to hack better? New brain. Shoot better? Get yourself a Cyber Weapon Interface. Be a better Psionic badass? Install yourself a Psi Decuplator. These don’t even cover implants you can install, which allow such abilities as cloaking, night vision, and enhanced armor. Both of these categories either grant the player abilities and powers or augment other categories of abilities and powers.

Don’t feel like gunning someone down? Then perhaps you will use your various psionic powers to handle the situation. Through these powers you can change dropped enemy weapons and ammo into health, create clones of yourself to help you in combat, infect enemies with madness and create chaos among enemy ranks, cause a monster to burst out of the body of an enemy and attack everything it can see, and several other powers. These powers can be purchased and taught to you by a faction member in the world hub, and others are acquired by playing the game and the choices you make. These powers all come at a price, however, often in the form of the force you are wielding costing some of your own health, being thrown back by the sheer power you are channeling, or by being mauled by the monster you created. Which is why I mostly stuck to hacking.

[caption id="attachment_11535" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Plenty of upgradable options."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00009.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-11535 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00009-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

Hacking was my bread and butter throughout the game experience. At first I had no idea how to do it, and basically ended every hacking encounter either dead or wounded with my vision impaired by the counter hack used against me. The process involves uploading viruses in an attempt to reduce the targets CyberHP before the same happens to you. You have an attack virus, a masking virus, a scanning virus, a shielding virus, and an overflow virus. Eventually I found a rhythm of what hacking skills to use to be more effective, or I just dumped enough points into it so it didn’t matter; again, I’m just not totally sure thanks to the impenetrable language and knowledge barrier. Regardless, it gave me access to some pretty sweet powers. I was possessing my enemies and scouting ahead or just gunning dudes down with sentry turrets, turning enemies into my hacked attack buddies, outright turning off their brains and killing them, or leaching power from them like some kind of remote access vampire.

Its almost overwhelming the number of ways you can enhance, augment, and modify your character. Every situation you come across, with the exception of computer terminals that can only be resolved by hacking, can be approached in a variety of ways. It feels good to build yourself up into the problem solving engine of your choosing, and I doubt I even saw all the different ways I can customize my character, I certainly didn’t touch on everything I experimented with here. The fact that I got so excited every time I found a new addition or ability for my character kept me going despite the fact I had no damn idea what was happening. It's a real shame that using all these powers can be as convoluted as they are.

[caption id="attachment_11549" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="I saw this screen a whole lot."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00047.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-11549 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00047-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

It's true, that handling these encounters with enemies is filled with options, but those options are buried under several convoluted menu screens. What this boils down to is, if you happen to see enemies before they see you, you can take the time to trawl these menus and employ some of your various abilities. More often then not, they will see you regardless of how hidden you think you are, and you just keep shooting them until the problem is solved. You can place some powers in a quick selection wheel to limit those to one menu, but you can only fit so many on that wheel. It feels like your being robbed when your limiting the number of skills and powers you can use in a reasonably speedy fashion to a small fraction of the total available to you.

To be fair, when I manage to find situations where I can use my abilities, I enjoy the experience. Hacking dudes and aspects of the environment is deviously good fun, and it's always funny when your opposition hacks back and your vision is filled with a laughing smiley face. One memorable moment for me was when I found a particularly stubborn door that I was determined to hack. Failure was taking its toll on my health, and eventually I just decided to give up after one last attempt. My last attempt left me with that screen filling smiley face I mentioned, and as I moved away from the door to attempt and hack myself to fix it, I fell into a hole the smiley was obscuring. What followed was a frenzied nightmare of combat with a gang of monsters while a massive smiley face laughed at me and made it impossible to see anything. It was terrible and awesome. I wish the game had more of these moments, but sadly it almost always devolves into using the biggest gun you can as fast as you can without other powers or abilities coming into play. The game never frowns on your choices, but I kind of wish it was friendlier for the non-gun related options.

[caption id="attachment_11538" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Also saw this screen a whole lot."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00013.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-11538 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00013-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

I generally hate tutorial levels in games, but E.Y.E. is a massive argument for why they can be important additions. I tried to figure this game out, but it's stuffed to the gills with ways to enhance and augment your character that all exist down spirals of menus and in game locations. Eventually, after consulting various forums, wikis, and twenty or so tutorial videos, I came to the same conclusion I did for my combat problems. Get the biggest gun and shoot more bullets. I tried to be a cyborg with the power to puppet master hapless rubes, but it just wasn’t worth it. These abilities don’t fix the level design issues, the enemies all have binoculars for eyes and believe the best approach to combat is to get close enough to hug me. The game buries you with options, but using them will just frustrate you and get you killed.

I really wanted to like this game. I still do, as it's just a few player mods away from being a great game. Fix the enemy AI, centralize the character upgrades from being spread out everywhere to being in just one set of menus, and perhaps add a waypoint system with a minimap. Suddenly all those options are fun and valid, just fix some of the translation problems and baby you got a game goin'.

[caption id="attachment_11546" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="I really love the random people you can find and talk to."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00043.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-11546 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-09-26_00043-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

This is one of those flawed games that I hope is destined to cobble together a really loyal and dedicated fanbase. One that will keep playing the game, modding it, and genuinely pouring love into the thing until its better then it was before. Like Vampire: The Masquerade: Redemption, this is a game with more ambition then it had room for, but that doesn’t mean a few people can’t come along and make it better then it was. To polish all those unique aspects of the experience until it really glows the way it should. I really like this game in some ways: when it worked, it worked well. It's a shame that right now it's buried under the weight of everything it tried to be. I can't tell you how much I want this game to get that cult following so that it can get better, so for all you masochists and gamers who love flawed gems that need some TLC, get this and fix it for me. The rest of you should stick to less ambitious but less flawed experiences in cyberpunk dystopias.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Warning:</strong> This opinion piece contains detailed narrative spoilers but few mechanical spoilers for <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, <em>ICO</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em> (2008) and <em>God of War</em>.</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify">To celebrate the release of <em>The ICO &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection</em>, I thought I would proclaim this: <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is overrated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Before I detail my blasphemous opinion, let me briefly overview the parts that likely led to various people declaring <em>SotC</em> a “masterpiece”. The aesthetics and landscapes wonderfully establish an atmosphere and setting of bleakness, of a world locked away and left to be slowly consumed by the elements. Ruins imply death and decay and what life there is treats you as if you were a pariah. The environment is almost hostile in its expansiveness, as if it's passive-aggressively suggesting that you too will get lost and be engulfed like everything else in this world. Fortunately, exploration turns out to be rewarding nonetheless due to the world feeling mysterious and laced with history. The minimalistic story is balanced in such a way that it implies a lot but still gives you enough information to let your imagination fill in the blanks. And, excluding two bosses that kind of phone it in, the combat doesn't waste your time with generic enemies. Instead, it consists entirely of truly large-scale encounters that beautifully blend boss battles with platforming and action-adventure in ways that many other games do not. Judged solely on these merits, I can understand why people who recognize and appreciate this atypical execution of typical game features love the game so much.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_ConceptArt.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11563" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_ConceptArt.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But those are just the overarching concepts, the ideas meant to thread together a specific authorial vision and player experience. If any one element of the whole fails in execution, then the entire experience falls apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>SotC</em>'s story is what caused the experience to fall apart for me. For those not in the know, it's a deconstruction of a prototypical "Damsel in Distress" plot: You know almost nothing about Mono, the girl you set out to save, yet Wander (the protagonist) is determined to "go to the ends of the Earth" to save her regardless of the consequences. The subversion to the archetypal heroic antics of such a plot sets in when it becomes clear that Wander's motivation, rather than leading to the typical string of successes where the protagonist ultimately saves the day and his love interest by blowing up the big bad's doom fortress, is actually obsessive to the point where it facilitates his own self-destruction. (And, if Wander is indeed in love with Mono, then then combing it with the lack of backstory can also make <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> a deconstruction of the Dulcinea effect.) <em>SotC</em> set out to tell a touching story of a tragic hero on a desperate and misguided quest to save the one he loves, but I think it failed. Conceptually, its themes are fine and easy to sympathize with, but I think the execution of those concepts failed because Wander's story was not presented in a way that made me care. (More on that in a bit.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Unsympathetic characters can work in literature or film because the distance you have between the character and yourself allows you to easily root both for and against them. This is not true for games. Whether you're a being so pure that flowers sprout where you step and entire populaces pray for your success or an embodiment rage and vengeance that is set on killing an entire pissed off pantheon, there is at least one constant for writing a good video game protagonist: The player must either sympathize with the character's actions, or they must pity them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The element of interactivity (and specifically player agency) is what establishes this difference from other media. And I think it was exactly this facet of the video game medium that clashed with the story the developers wanted to tell. Why? Because <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is a game about taking orders. Orders from Wander about what he wants to accomplish. Orders from Dormin about want it wants in order to facilitate what Wander wants. And, most damningly, orders from the developer about how you should play their game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I'd equate my experience playing <em>SotC</em> with performing a variant of the Milgram experiment where I was “the teacher”, Wander was “the learner”, and developer Team ICO (by way of the game) was “the experimenter”. After "administering a few shocks" by downing the first couple of Colossi, I was worried about the toll it was taking on Wander. I didn't have access to Wander's thoughts, whatever they might be, so I had no idea what the emotional damage was. However, the malicious threads of energy emanating from defeated Colossi did cause me to pause to consider Wander's physical health. "Should I go on? Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all," I thought. "Please continue," the game responded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After a couple more Colossi, it was evident that an additional ominous and shadowy figure appeared every single time Wander defeated another boss. "Who are those people anyway? The spirits of the Colossi? And should I be worried about them? They don't exactly look happy to see Wander," I wondered aloud. "The experiment requires that you continue," the game responded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After yet another batch of Colossi, the physical toll of it all on Wander became much clearer; those threads of energy didn't just seem malicious, they actually were malicious. Slowly but surely, they were corrupting Wander's body and making it doubtful that he'd survive whatever was happening to him. The game saw my towering doubts and told me: "It is absolutely essential that you continue."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And continue I did. I thought there might be some kind of emotional or educational pay-off to what I was enduring. After the last Colossus was slain, after Dormin rose and fell, and after Wander got his wish but couldn't really go on to enjoy it, I finally realized something. The game didn't explicitly tell me this, and I was free to quit any time I wished, but only by the end of the game did I truly grasp the undercurrent to the entire story: "You have no other choice, you must go on."</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Dormin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11564" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Dormin.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="351" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In <em>SotC</em>, I can play as a non-idiot to the best of my abilities, but I can never cure Wander of his idiotic short-sightedness. I did not want to be submissive to this game's demands, but because Team ICO provided no flexibility in their story, it caused constant cognitive dissonance and frustration whenever I perceived idiotic player character behavior that was beyond my control. <em>SotC</em> is not the only game where this happens, but it's one of the most damnable because, as aforementioned, the story and the gameplay are tightly intertwined, which makes Wander's idiocy far more poisonous here than in other games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You might be thinking: “By golly, if you want choice and lots of player agency, just go play some highly customizable RPG!” A valid suggestion, but I think player agency can still exist in sufficient quantities in story-driven and highly linear games like <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>. I'll go into this more in a follow-up piece, but for now I'd like to bring up the 2008 reboot of <em>Prince of Persia</em>. <em>PoP</em>, while more non-linear than <em>SotC</em>, is still effectively a linear story but just broken up into little homogenous pieces. Whatever choices you make throughout are inconsequential since, like a jigsaw puzzle, you'll always piece together roughly the same result in the end regardless of what your actual progression to that end was. However, in the very last moments of the game, The Prince (your player character) is provided with a real and important choice. He can acquiesce to Elika's wishes, or he can defy them. Defiance is backed up by a cutscene, an Achievement / Trophy, and an Epilogue DLC, clearly making it the canonical option. However, I much prefer <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2009/01/prince-of-quitting.html" target="_blank">the other choice</a>. Why? Because it lets The Prince actually complete a character arc. For the entire game he's this smart-mouthed, somewhat egotistical and self-serving jerk, but if he lets Elika get her wish, he makes this huge decision that's counter to his initial behavior and that represents that he is now willing to defer judgment to others. The canonical choice doesn't have any of this and just corroborates that The Prince is selfish, doesn't care about others' views, and didn't learn a damn thing. <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is the same way, except there isn't any choice whatsoever. Instead, you're just railroaded into never escaping Wander's self-destructive tragedy. It doesn't matter whether the choice I wanted to make is canonical, but it does matter that I never had a choice to begin with. (Also, yes, I realize the anachronism in referencing <em>PoP</em> as it came out some years after <em>SotC</em>. This didn't preclude Team ICO of thinking of something similar or better though.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What really got me steamed up though, is that <em>SotC</em> is wont to chastise the player for making “bad choices” that lead to self-destruction despite the game's minimalism working against itself here. It criticizes us for unleashing an evil being for the sake of personal gain without making it clear why Dormin is evil or why it deserved to be banished. For all we know, Emon et al may be puritanical zealots who trapped Dormin due to disapproving of its power to upset what they believed was the “natural order” of things. Who's to say that the deal between Dormin and Wander isn't just quid pro quo between two oppressed entities rather than the implied Faustian pact with the devil? The vagueness of the story makes this alternative interpretation easy to conclude, deftly undermining the melancholic and tragic tone of the game and making the authorial voice seem patronizing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Regardless of which is the “correct” interpretation, when your actions are highly limited and carefully plotted in advance, how can you feel guilty for “evil” behavior when you have no say in the matter (other than turning off the console in disgust)? One can't possibly expect the player to be responsible for events when they have no agency. And since the chastising via deconstruction is part of the game's raison d'être, hopefully you can understand why I was so underwhelmed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Lord_Emon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11565" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Lord_Emon.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I think it's also worth mentioning Kratos as he was characterized in <em>God of War I</em>. He isn't a hero (by any stretch of the imagination), but he's still manages to be a very tragic and pitiable figure. And I think he's a much better character than Wander. First off, I appreciated that it was clear that Kratos was rude, crude, lewd from the get-go. <em>God of War</em> sets the tone immediately and doesn't do any piddling about with the nature of the player character like what happened with Wander in <em>SotC</em>. To be fair, deconstruction without parody or mountains of hyperbole practically demands subversion of expectation, but I see that as an argument against how the characterization of Wander was dealt with in<em> SotC</em>. Secondly, Kratos' actions partially contribute the failure of his own goals, which heightens the tragedy of his situation and makes him pitiable despite being detestable for his wanton behavior. By contrast, though the end result was probably not what he anticipated, Wander ultimately succeeds in his goal of rescuing Mono, and the comparatively fewer hardships he goes through made it seem as if Team ICO wanted us to root for Wander despite vilifying him and the player's “complicity” in his story. Thirdly, the tragedy of Kratos culminates when he attempts suicide in an effort to escape the hopeless life that he and the Gods have conspired to write. As much as I may abhor Kratos' violence and machismo, I can't be help but feel genuinely sad when he and I both reflect upon what a trainwreck he is. I'm always most moved when media takes a seemingly unlikeable character and uses context to turn them into something that the audience can sympathize with, even if for but a moment. <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> has none of this since Wander starts and ends a flat character, never fazed by his physical corruption, never pausing to reflect on the ruination he creates, and certainly never wavering from his idealized and self-justified goal. To me, Wander is a poster boy for the claim that “an unexamined life is not worth living.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Colossal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11567" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Colossal.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mono isn't much better, as she serves as little more than literal dead weight. People who liked the companion cube of the <em>Portal</em> series or the generic doomed hometowns / family members / whatever lazily tacked on in order to “characterize” protagonists of various other games may like Mono, but I get disgruntled whenever any given game declares that a player character adores something without giving much (if any) reason for the player behind that character to be sympathetic to these sentiments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Whether Wander is trying to save his lover, his sister, or a VIP he failed to protect during guard duty doesn't matter. How Mono died and why she is cursed doesn't matter. How Wander acquired his sword, his bow, and his horse doesn't really matter. What does matter is why I should care about the portion of the story that I get to experience once I pick up the controller and start playing the game. I fully understand what the characters' motivations are and what they want to get out of the story, but what do I, the player, get out of the story?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I find this particularly problematic because, for stuff like various games in the <em>Mario</em> series (or, if you want something more accurate but also more obscure, then think of the <em>Viewtiful Joe</em> series), it's typically easy to separate the gameplay and the story and enjoy one aspect if you're not fond of the other. Though Mario's usual goal of saving Princess Peach is effectively the same as Wander's goal of saving Mono, Mario's goal is not inextricably intertwined with the gameplay his series features. Mega Man and Kirby and Samus Aran can all perform the actions of running, jumping and shooting projectiles without any connection to the stories and worlds of the <em>Mario</em> universe. But killing the colossi in <em>SotC</em> can not be separated from the story; there are no optional encounters. This is why my distaste for some parts of the narrative cripples any enjoyment I might try to extract from the game. Disliking the story changes everything; it causes the expansive environments to feel empty, the collectibles to feel even more pointless, and the atmosphere to shift from bleak and hauntingly beautiful to dreary and utterly depressing. Since the experience is contingent on perceiving all aspects of the game as working in harmony, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> creates, moreso than many other games, a polarizing “love it or hate it” divide.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Avion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11568" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Avion.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">You may think that I'm frustrated because I'm railing against a norm and hoping for a higher standard for game stories. This is true, but a large chunk of my frustration comes from recognizing that developer Team ICO already solved this problem with a previous game of theirs and bewilderingly did not carry this solution forward to <em>SotC</em>. That previous game, known as <em>ICO</em>, endeavored to examine the much-loathed escort mission and turn it in something worthwhile and integral to an experience instead of its all-too-common application as filler for a game focused on something entirely different. And, to their credit, Team ICO did a pretty good job. Rather than hitting the pitfall of having a nigh-invulnerable badass or an insufferable burden for half (or the entirety) of the two-person team, both Ico and Yorda have notable strengths and weaknesses. (Yorda's strengths are generally more artificial, and I'd add more cynical from a design perspective as well, than Ico's for gameplay purposes, but that's not relevant for the point I'm trying to put forth here.) Alone and divided, Ico and Yorda would be nearly helpless, but with their powers combined, they have a significantly improved chance of surviving and escaping their fates. Beyond that though, I loved the burgeoning sense of the companionship between Ico and Yorda as well as the various things included to humanize them. Dragging Yorda around could indeed be burdensome, but she was still helpful and autonomous occasionally and it was evident that any instances of resistance were borne out of strong feelings of trepidation. Ico was great too; he's barely able to help himself, yet he leaps to the rescue and valiantly defends Yorda for as long as he can. The story of Ico and Yorda and the relationship that formed over the course of the game was heartwarming for its portrayal of childlike compassion and innocence. The story of <em>SotC</em> initially seems like it will cover similar themes, but it takes a much more cynical approach that ultimately twists those themes into stubbornness and horrible delusion for everyone involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I'm not saying that Team ICO should've done another game-spanning escort mission or something like what was done with The Prince and Elika in <em>Prince of Persia</em>, but I am saying that there is a huge disparity between how much Wander cares about Mono and how much the player cares about her. This is a core of the story and, as I've already mentioned regarding how intertwined everything is, my distaste for this greatly sours my opinion of <em>SotC</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Interestingly, a bit of that <em>ICO</em> sense of companionship can still be found in the relationship between Wander and his horse Agro. She is absolutely vital for traversing the huge surroundings and dealing with some of the bosses, and when combined with her steadfast loyalty, she becomes a very endearing character in her own right. Wander even has the ability to pet Agro for no other reason than to express gratitude. In fact, I found Agro so endearing that, when she falls with a collapsing bridge and (temporarily) seems dead, I genuinely felt mournful (a sentiment that is not evoked often from video games). It also (again, temporarily) cemented my hate for the character of Wander since it appeared as if his obsessive quest killed his one undoubtedly faithful and lovable companion in order to save a girl I didn't care one iota about.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_HolySite.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11569" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_HolySite.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I'm also of the opinion that deconstruction by itself is not always sufficient. Let me use an analogy. Imagine you are in a fairly comfortable house. This house has some flaws and imperfections, but its structure fits the norm of the houses that surround yours and that you are familiar with. One fateful day, a man with a wrecking ball comes to demolish your house. As he begins to create gaping holes in your walls, you demand to know what he's doing. The deconstructor replies by saying that he wants to make you aware that your house is made out of rubbish and that you should feel bad for blissfully ignoring this blatantly obvious fact. If he's persuasive, you'll listen until the end. Once the house is in shambles, he sits with a self-satisfied look on his face, enjoying his handiwork for a moment. Then, he begins to drive off. “Wait!” you exclaim. “Where are you going?” “I'm done,” he responds. “What about my house?” you ask incredulously. “You did a great job explaining what was wrong with it, but I assumed you were going to tell me how to build a better house after you were done tearing down my old one.” Upon hearing this, the deconstructor stares blankly at you. You glare at him expectantly, but he can only muster “No, sorry, I just deconstruct.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Deconstruction without reconstruction is the equivalent of cognitive blue-balling. If you were left with aporia (as the Milgram experiment analogy might suggest), then perhaps the game would have taught you something. But how can you learn from your mistakes if <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> doesn't give you the choice to repent or explore alternatives? When choice is irrelevant, the weight of the moral implications of your actions is nonexistent. You can legitimately claim you were just mechanically following orders.</p>
<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Malus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11570" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SotC_Malus.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="600" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify">If the lack of reconstruction won't advise us in design, can any other lessons can be learned from this game? Is the lesson that love can become obsessive and dangerous? We already know that from stalkers and sociopathic relationships. Is the lesson that action without introspection can lead to self-destruction? Who hasn’t learned that yet? Is it that someone who is better equipped and more organized than you will eventually ruin your plans? Well, that one's a real keeper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are other things I could complain about, like the collectible sidequests and the Time Attack mode diluting the story in an effort to make <em>SotC</em> more “game-like” than <em>ICO</em>, but the things I've detailed above are much more significant. They are the big issues that eclipse the smaller positive and negative aspects of the game. The bottom line is, unlike many games, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is not a story in which I and the developer worked together to craft a desired experience. Rather, I felt it was a story imposed, a story contrived in such a way that the developer gets to deliver a specific message regardless of whether the player wants to hear it and whether it even applies. <em>SotC</em> just beats you with "the point" and continues to do so long after it is necessary. Players complicit in the developer's desires probably think <em>SotC</em> is great for its single-minded exploration of particular concepts, but I wasn't convinced that I had any role or, more importantly, responsibility in the tale. Wander's struggles were not my own, and thus his suffering and success were not my own. It's a game worth playing up until you realize what Wander's quest ultimately entails, but thereafter the game has nothing to offer you beyond detailing Wander's slow death spiral and showcasing the hollow spectacle of big boss battles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you're satisfied with that, then more power to you, but I firmly believe <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> does not deserve its God-King status among art games. If you have yet to take the plunge and make up your own mind, consider this a stern warning that it may not turn out all it's cracked up to be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&gt;the undercurrent to the entire story: “You have no other choice, you must go on.”


Seems a little to me like you've missed the wood for the trees. The main theme of the game is communicated through the minute-by-minute game-play itself; that's why critics rave about it.

The basic skills you need to defeat a Colossus involve holding on and letting go at the right times to recover your strength as you learn how to climb it.  In fact, there's basically only one action button in the game, which is used for hanging on to ledges, drawing the bow, and preparing a stab.

The whole way through the game you practise these skills and have them tested - learn when to hold on, when to strategically let go, where the weak points are, then move on.

This continues until the very end where plot stuff happens, and Wander finds himself being sucked into a vortex.  This is a playable section, where you are climbing away from the vortex and towards Mono.  Using all the skills you've learned in the game, it's possible to actually keep this segment going forever.  You can always resist the vortex, but you can never quite reach Mono.  And this leads to the central theme running through the game.  

Wander wants Mono back for whatever reason, it's not even that important why.  The point is he will go to the ends of the earth to do it, sacrificing himself and who knows what else; he could go on forever and the game will go on forever until the player learns the message of the game, and that is learning when to let go.

You've been trained in 16 epic battles, that require you to learn how to let go (the fundamental mechanic of the game is your skill in holding on or not holding on) and then you are given a never-ending challenge that the only way to move on from - to bring closure to the narrative, the game, the player and of course Wander - is to consciously acknowledge that it's time to let go, and to go ahead and do it.

Everyone who played the game would have struggled for a bit trying to get to the Mono, and I think that the moment when the player realises what the game is asking of them and actually puts down the controller and watches their avatar tumble to his doom is one of the profound moments that make people rave about this game.  The player cannot complete the game without being acted upon by the game.  Pretty heavy stuff.]]></wp:comment_content>

The point is he will go to the ends of the earth to do it, sacrificing himself and who knows what else; he could go on forever and the game will go on forever until the player learns the message of the game, and that is learning when to let go.

You've been trained in 16 epic battles, that require you to learn how to let go (the fundamental mechanic of the game is your skill in holding on or not holding on) and then you are given a never-ending challenge that the only way to move on from - to bring closure to the narrative, the game, the player and of course Wander - is to consciously acknowledge that it's time to let go, and to go ahead and do it.

Everyone who played the game would have struggled for a bit trying to get to the Mono, and I think that the moment when the player realises what the game is asking of them and actually puts down the controller and watches their avatar tumble to his doom is one of the profound moments that make people rave about this game.  The player cannot complete the game without being acted upon by the game.  Pretty heavy stuff.

Ending the meta-story about your experiences with the game perhaps, but not the game's story itself.";s:7:"POST_id";s:5:"11555";s:21:"POST_comments_listing";s:3:"all";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:24:"/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"ToIYB826rBwAAHevLhkAAABA";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:24:"/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:48:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:10:"1667006603";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:111:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:3:"*/*";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:12:"gzip,deflate";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:15:"HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE";s:3:"115";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:48:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8";s:21:"HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH";s:14:"XMLHttpRequest";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:51:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-admin/edit-comments.php";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1745";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:11:"HTTP_PRAGMA";s:8:"no-cache";s:18:"HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL";s:8:"no-cache";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I appreciate your effort for that suggestion, but I don't see that as the same as a conscious moral choice to let go of one's obsession (which is a choice that I wanted to be presented with). To me, the ending sequence is more like: "You can hold on to this rope dangling over the edge of a cliff forever, or you can let go and give in to the inevitable." It's putting you in a situation where you can't win, and asking whether you want to futilely resist until your strength gives out or to kill yourself to speed up the process of failure.

edit: Oh, and if we're going to go with your "letting go" theme, I'd counter by saying you only let go (or retreat) so you could come back stronger the next time. I think it's a real stretch to say that theme carries forward into the ending sequence.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Presentation. There are games that present you with some poorly executed semblance of a story, when that's really just a cover for the fact that the game is nothing but boss battles. There are games where the story is really well-done and the bosses fit perfectly into that... or not at all.

And then there's SotC. The focus of the game, to me, is more on your actions than anything else. The story, the background, so much of it lies there. How your actions are presented- little more than a boy facing such stone behemoths, for example- can tell you how much Mono means to him, OR how strongly he believes that he must bring her back. Or both. Ultimately, it's left up to you to decide. I, personally, never did.

I feel like what you're doing is akin to analyzing the Mona Lisa's smile. Sure, you could take into account all sorts of archetypes, and the artist's previous works, as you try to figure it out. But it's just as likely that it's left up to your interpretation. 

Feel free to do as you have done, and look in-depth into what the game's presented to you. But you may well be missing the forest for the trees on this one.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For me, this game is about imagination. Sure, you have to follow a story arc that you really don't want to because you know what's coming. Though, it's more than the fact that you have to, you get to make up your own story as to why. I've played this game through three times and I still don't know the definitive reasons for why anyone in this game is here. I have my ideas, and I've read the ideas of others, but none of them are positive. This game, to me, is about the experience of making the story make sense to you. I hate people who say "If you didn't like it, then you didn't get it.", and that's not what I'm trying to convey. What I think when I read your review is: "if you didn't like it, then the story you came up with while you were playing it wasn't good enough for you." 

Not liking Shadow of the Colossus is the same as not liking shadow puppets, or the shapes you see in clouds. It is what you think it is, and if you don't think highly of it, then that's perfectly fine.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I find it strange that people (and you're not the only one) automatically bring up other games and talk about how their stories were presented even worse. My point is not that <em>SotC</em> is somehow worse than some other games (plenty of video game stories are much worse), but rather that it doesn't live up to the expectations common opinion has created for this game.

I understand what Mono means to Wander and the extent that he is going to in order to save her. That understanding doesn't change that I was given me little reason to care about Mono when there was no interaction with her and nearly zero backstory as well. It seems like players are supposed to feel sympathy by drawing upon their own experiences with relationships, but Mono could've been replaced with a bag of bricks and the end result would've been the same for what she meant to the player.

For instance, if Mono was a VIP and Wander failed at his job of guarding her, Wander trading his life for hers via Dormin's power would make plenty of sense. But when the game plays sad and sorrowful music every time a Colossus is killed, it feels like the developers are adamantly saying the player is doing a bad or wrong thing, even if a player's interpretation says that it's a noble sacrifice. That (among other things), just doesn't allow me to craft a story that would've worked for me.";s:7:"POST_id";s:5:"11555";s:21:"POST_comments_listing";s:3:"all";s:15:"SERVER_SOFTWARE";s:12:"Apache/2.2.9";s:11:"REQUEST_URI";s:24:"/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php";s:4:"PATH";s:28:"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";s:16:"REDIRECT_HANDLER";s:10:"php-script";s:15:"REDIRECT_STATUS";s:3:"200";s:9:"UNIQUE_ID";s:24:"ToIoKM26rBQAAHDr8E0AAACw";s:10:"SCRIPT_URL";s:24:"/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php";s:10:"SCRIPT_URI";s:48:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php";s:25:"WM_UCONTROL_XMLRPC_SERVER";s:16:"http://10.9.2.13";s:13:"ACCESS_DOMAIN";s:22:"s132493.gridserver.com";s:15:"DATABASE_SERVER";s:34:"internal-db.s132493.gridserver.com";s:9:"SITE_ROOT";s:12:"/home/132493";s:12:"SITE_CGIROOT";s:20:"/home/132493/cgi-bin";s:13:"SITE_HTMLROOT";s:43:"/home/132493/domains/nightmaremode.net/html";s:12:"HTTP_PHPCONF";s:9:"223871124";s:9:"HTTP_HOST";s:17:"nightmaremode.net";s:15:"HTTP_USER_AGENT";s:111:"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)";s:11:"HTTP_ACCEPT";s:3:"*/*";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE";s:14:"en-us,en;q=0.5";s:20:"HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING";s:12:"gzip,deflate";s:19:"HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET";s:30:"ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7";s:15:"HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE";s:3:"115";s:15:"HTTP_CONNECTION";s:10:"keep-alive";s:12:"CONTENT_TYPE";s:48:"application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8";s:21:"HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH";s:14:"XMLHttpRequest";s:12:"HTTP_REFERER";s:51:"http://nightmaremode.net/wp-admin/edit-comments.php";s:14:"CONTENT_LENGTH";s:4:"1067";s:11:"HTTP_COOKIE";s:0:"";s:11:"HTTP_PRAGMA";s:8:"no-cache";s:18:"HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL";s:8:"no-cache";s:16:"SERVER_SIGNATURE";s:68:"<address>Apache/2.2.9 Server at nightmaremode.net Port 80</address>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That argument makes very little sense. In fact, it is something Ramunas defended in regards to the newest Prince of Persia (you didn't have to save the Princess - you could turn the console off).

But really, does not playing a game mean the Wanderer gave up his quest? Can I say Charles Kane hasn't died because I stopped watching it after three seconds into the film? Can I say the Creature fails to kill Frankenstein at the end because I stopped reading the book? 

One's experience with the story isn't what constitutes the story, least to say the plot. 

There isn't any difference to the Prince of Persia example either. Whether or not the saving of Elika came before or after the credits is irrelevant; or does old movie where the credits are screened before the film means any ending the viewer chooses is "acceptable"?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't know. There just seem to be at least a few things in life (a few relationships come to mind) that are exactly like what you're describing: Where I want desperately to carry something through to the finish - because I'm curious, and because quitting doesn't feel satisfying. But I know it's wrong to continue, and I have to just stop and not start it again, even though I could potentially continue it at any time. I, at least, find that analogue interesting, because it actually connects with my life in a way that saving the world or burning orphanages does not.
Also notable, though, is that you're not really morally culpable for what you do in a game EVER. I've always found this to be the most problematic part of a moral decision system in games. Whereas in real life, it would be wrong to continue, here you're not really hurting anyone, and curiosity is a completely valid reason to keep going. I think the game's true failing isn't that you can't feel guilty because you HAD to continue, but rather that you can't feel guilty because you didn't actually do anything wrong by continuing.
And as far as the game's story versus your meta-story, it seems that if you make choices that lead to an ending in a game, then that was the game's story for you. Similarly, if you haven't completed a game with multiple endings, the game's story for you is not all the endings, but none of them (yet). And then if you never complete that game, it will remain none of them. The end was where you stopped playing. It is not clear to me that this is different simply because the game has one ending. If you never play it, then it doesn't happen in that game-universe, and that is the game's story that time.]]></wp:comment_content>

Character choice would be great, yes, other paths when realizing how futile Wander's quest is, would have been great. 

But, to this day, no media gives unlimited choice when experiencing it. Can Frodo Baggins stop in his tracks, yell 'screw this' and return to the Shire just by closing the book? Can you hold Michael's murdering spree in his quest for power after the Don dies? No.

SOTC gave me a role. A selfish one, yes. One that managed to turn me sad when pointlessly killing the colossi. Made me mournful yes, after Argo's death. But this is the role of the story unfolding before me, guided by the linearity of the creator's vision. I see nothing wrong with it. 

I just hope that future games will make me experience more of these feelings as the media becomes more mature.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The player doesn't determine the story. 

He can be given freedoms, yes, but his actions are still bound by what the programmer allows and the plot is still bound by what the writer wrote - you can't, for example, choose to buy a gun and eat pasta in a Mario game. For all its choices, Commander Shepard can't fly home to Earth. Yes, there are win and lose scenarios... the same way books have paragraphs and movies have editing. The inherent aspects of the medium does not invalidates the narrative.

There is nothing about a game that can invalidate what constitutes story, plot and narrative. There can be games without those - the same way as movies and writings without narrative can also exist - but wearing the "game" label does not invalidates the plot in any way or form.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I finally got around to reading this. I have to say there is a great idea in here, comparing Shadow of the Colossus to the Milgrim Experiment, genius that was. However, I can't get on board with anything else, not even that I disagree, but it's full of logical fallacies only one of which I've seen brought up here. I could easily write a huge post just pointing out and explaining the errors here, but it's late and I'm tired. I'll list them instead.

-Credits do not signify the end of a work, the end signifies the end of the work.
-PoP fails at pretty much everything you claim Shadow of the Colossus to fail at. It's one of the worst put together games of '08.
-The teachers in the Milgrim experiment could have stopped at any time, but for the most part didn't. The differences in stakes does not absolve the similarity in action only the scale.
-Wander is one of the more well defined characters because he does not speak or have cutscenes showing him doing stuff, but rather he is characterized through his verbs.
-You are railroaded because Wander would do nothing else. That is who he is. The player is not the character. You interchange their positions several times.
-Kraots and Wander are more alike than you think. It's just Wander is more stripped down because there are no cutscenes or backstory.
-The player can be attached to Mono in the same way players attach themselves to empty Shells like Samus or Gordon Freemon. They are representations of the dearly departed.
-It is not about being with the girl, it is about sacrifice. This is a cursed land and Wander knows the stakes.
-We can, but it is not necessary to sympathize with Wander, but to pity him.
-Shadow of the Colossus is not a drama, it is classical tragedy. Use correct literary theory.
-There is no message to Shadow of the Colossus. It is not an Aesop fable. It does not beat you over the head with a point. It has no summed up point.
-Nice analogy of the house, but that is a deconstructionist's job. To further the metaphor, you hire a wrecking crew to tear the house down and then you hire a construction crew to rebuild it. Reconstruction is the next artist's job.
-Deconstructionism makes its point through the tearing down of tropes and standards and then holding them up to the light. No comment need be or should be made. It's the difference between Watchmen and Superhero movie.
-Finally and this is unfortunate, because you based your whole argument on it, Shadow of the Colossus is not deconstructionism. It's minimalism. They are close together on the artistic spectrum (If there is such a thing.) mainly because minimalism lead into the post-modernism movement where deconstructionism was born, but there are wide gaps of difference.

And that's only off the top of my head without explanations or evidence. I'd have to read it again a few more times and then go point by point. Not now though, maybe later.]]></wp:comment_content>

-The player can be attached to Mono in the same way players attach themselves to empty Shells like Samus or Gordon Freemon. They are representations of the dearly departed.
-It is not about being with the girl, it is about sacrifice. This is a cursed land and Wander knows the stakes.
-We can, but it is not necessary to sympathize with Wander, but to pity him.
-Shadow of the Colossus is not a drama, it is classical tragedy. Use correct literary theory.
-There is no message to Shadow of the Colossus. It is not an Aesop fable. It does not beat you over the head with a point. It has no summed up point.
-Nice analogy of the house, but that is a deconstructionist's job. To further the metaphor, you hire a wrecking crew to tear the house down and then you hire a construction crew to rebuild it. Reconstruction is the next artist's job.
-Deconstructionism makes its point through the tearing down of tropes and standards and then holding them up to the light. No comment need be or should be made. It's the difference between Watchmen and Superhero movie.
-Finally and this is unfortunate, because you based your whole argument on it, Shadow of the Colossus is not deconstructionism. It's minimalism. They are close together on the artistic spectrum (If there is such a thing.) mainly because minimalism lead into the post-modernism movement where deconstructionism was born, but there are wide gaps of difference.

And that's only off the top of my head without explanations or evidence. I'd have to read it again a few more times and then go point by point.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[- I find it ironic that you claim logical fallacies and then turn around and use a tautology. Those things are notoriously unhelpful, so I ask: What defines "the end"? Furthermore, the matter of choice I brought up wasn't focusing on <strong>the</strong> end (as in, the ending that the developer holds as canonical and intended), it was talking about <strong>an</strong> end. I ultimately didn't include something I thought about in this particular revision of the piece, but in the comments on Wave I mentioned both <em>Redder</em> (where you can quit while you're ahead to counteract the damaging effects of obsession) and a suggestion for putting a branch in the story. Wander, I assume, justifies his actions by claiming it's a self-sacrifice that he's choosing to endure. My idea for a moral choice branch involved the "death" of Agro spurring an epiphany where Wander realizes that it's not just him who suffers. From there, he ultimately would have to choose between grim determination to carry on his quest or leaving before even worse things happen. (If one wonders about the Colossi spirits already trapped inside of Wander or how Emon would still hunt Wander, I also offer the alternative of Wander plunging his sword into his body in order to expel the spirits and allow him to be with Mono in death.)

- <em>Prince of Persia</em> (2008) is indeed a bad game for some terrible design decisions and schizophrenic characterization. The overall quality of that game, however, is irrelevant to the point I was bringing (or wanted to bring) up. I never claimed that <em>PoP </em>was better, I just extracted one piece of it (that I happened to think was good) because I thought that piece (wherein both The Prince and Wander unleash a powerful spirit in order to save their love interest) related strongly.

- I'm not exactly sure what you're addressing your third point at. In any case, I think I covered my take on that in <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/why-shadow-of-the-colossus-is-overrated-11555/#comment-2996" rel="nofollow">a previous comment</a>.

- I wonder what your connotation on "well-defined" is. What Wander strives for is indeed clear and well-defined, but I don't see how that automatically raises him above being a flat character.

- Wait, what? How can you say the player is not the character and then say they interchange roles? Regardless, Wander would be fine as a film character, but I don't like him as a video game character because I kept thinking: "Why should I <em>play</em> his life?" The element of interactivity does not add anything to the character and only serves to frustrate me. Control over a character usually indicates at least some flexibility in <em>how </em>things are done if not necessarily in <em>what</em> things are done. I felt no flexibility whatsoever, and I was saddled with character I had no interest (and never developed any interest) in playing.

- I also ultimately didn't include this in the piece, but in earlier revisions I implied a connection between <em>SotC</em> and Jackson Pollock's art (which I generally have a distaste for). Like Pollock's work, some vague remnants of things could be interpreted as having depth, but I think a bit too much was left to the imagination in <em>SotC</em>. A few commentors made a strawman out of that by claiming I said I wanted everything explained to me, but they completely missed the nuance I was going for.

- I considered commenting on this assertion in the piece as well, but I felt the context of <em>SotC</em> made the situation something I couldn't quite relate to. Have I ever been in a situation where I had to perform self-sacrifice in the name of love? Yes, and I even faced consequences almost as extreme. Did my sacrifice entail stealing a sword and defeating colossal beings to appease a spiritual entity that could help me? No, and that's one of the things that makes it difficult for me to empathize with Wander. He may have a realistic motive, but the hardships he faces are hyperbolic and too fictional to work as another other than a quaint metaphor.

- <em>SotC</em> might be about sacrifice, but sacrifice typically has a goal or purpose. My issue is why I should care about any of it. If the game was supposed to have me fill in Wander with myself and Mono with a lover who I was willing to sacrifice for, then I still think it fails for me because it did not reflect the experiences I had and the choices I made nor did it allow for any semblance of either to be expressed.

- I don't think <em>SotC</em> quite fits the mold of a classical tragedy. Yes, circumstances outside of Wander's control invoke some tragic consequences, but I still think Wander's quest was an overall success. IMO, <em>God of War</em> had much better examples of tragedy, such as where Kratos kills his family and the last Spartan, results he clearly didn't want but that happened anyway. There's also the matter that tragedy is defined as a variant of drama and that classical tragedy typically involves someone of high stature. We're not given any indication that Wander was anyone important in his society. I'd even say it's the opposite since other members saw fit to punish someone who flaunted the "rules" of that society.

- I took the stance that <em>SotC</em> had some kind of message because it felt clear to me that <em>ICO</em> wasn't a game just for the sake of being a game. I felt convinced that Team ICO had a reason for taking aspects that could be seen in a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game and trying to make them more realistic for <em>SotC</em>. Also, I think the marked shift in tone from the music during boss battles to the music after them wasn't an accident. I took it as implicit commentary from the developer.

- There's a nuance here too though. A wrecking crew is more mindless than a deconstructor. A wrecking crew doesn't try to make any point. They're just doing their job and could care less whether the destroyed thing is rebuilt better or worse later or just left ruined and vacant. To me, that outlook is closer to what parodists do. A deconstructor, by contrast, tries to make a point and encourages something that's closer to an ideal they hold or at least something that's less flawed. At least, that's how I see it. My view of a deconstructor is one who paves the way for reconstruction, but your view seems to interpret such an author as just a wrecking crew. It's a fundamental disagreement over definitions.

- I find that hard to believe, because I feel a minimalist <em>SotC </em> wouldn't have any explanatory cutscenes or emotion-evoking music. And I think it certainly wouldn't have Emon mentioning how Wander was deceived by Dormin. It would just be Wander defeating the Colossi and letting the player decide what the hell happened and what it all means.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-End_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11578" title="The End_1" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-End_1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="278" /></a>

BBC's <em><a href="http://playtheend.com/">The End</a></em> has a laudable goal: to get people to think about death. As such, it falls under the encompassing banner of educational games, but it presents its concepts in a way that makes them seem unlike any sort of learning you've ever done.

And it has a card game, too*.

At its core, <em>The End</em> is a prime example of that most venerable of genres: the gimmick based 2-D platformer. Godfathered by <em>Braid</em>, <em>The End </em>is a pretty standard run from left to right platformer with a neat little gimmick, the ability to turn shadows into solid platforms. Unfortunately, it's one that doesn't work especially well. Rather than try to model all sorts of light, the game takes a shortcut and just makes shadows from the players perspective pretty much only when they are necessary to advance.

Whenever you beat a platforming level, you get to play a card game. Did I mention that? A third of the time it's a card game against a horrible mash up of Meat Boy, Doctor Fetus (from Meat Boy), and Goro from <em>Street Fighter</em>. He is my favorite.

Let's back up again, before this review is taken over by my love of in-game card games. <em>The End</em> is noteworthy because it lets you create a character. It gives you a lot of customization options, and it doesn't gender them. Gender is determined by appearance: if you give yourself a skirt and a girly hairstyle, your gender is implied. Same if you have a beard. If you have a pink beard and a skirt, like I do, you might be some sort of alien who learned how to dress like a human from movies.

And then when the game starts up, you promptly die. I don't know quite what this is supposed to mean, besides that it enables the light controlling mechanism for no reason, and it lets you play Deathcards for Death Objects, which are pointless collectibles.

You get these collectibles by playing the card game.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-End_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11579" title="The End_2" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-End_2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="278" /></a>

I wasn't a big fan of the platforming in the game, but I loved the card game. I loved it, ludonarrative dissonance and all. The basic premise is ludicrously simple: you are dealt a hand of eight hexagonal tiles, then place them on a hexagonal board. Each hex has three numbers on it, and each determines the value of two sides of the piece. Higher numbers beat lower. That's it. That's the game. Well, that and whenever you win a game, you get a collectible power, which allows you to give your pieces bonuses; at first you can raise the value of a specific side, or protect a specific side from damage, but eventually you get powers that let you rotate pieces or (my personal favorite) transfer all the points from one piece to another piece, allowing you to capture four tiles at the last second in an unbelievably cheap fashion.

Okay, I'll be negative first: this game's existence makes absolutely no fucking sense. Why are these pseudodeific monsters challenging you to card games for motorcycle helmets? No reason. It goes further than that, though? But why is the game asking a dead person questions about life and death at the end of each level? No reason. Why do you choose answers by going into doors locked with keys found midlevel? No reason. Why can you make shadows solid? No reason. Everything here makes as much sense as a psychic tire on a killing spree, but that doesn't stop it from being fun. And <em>The End</em>, despite its heavy “subject matter”, hits fun on the head with this little “mini game”.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i4BKwYvNE3U" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
I'll be completely honest with you: the educational component means zilch to this game. It's taking an educational route at odds with <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/08/the-cat-and-the-coup-8683/">games like <em>The Cat and the Coup</em></a>. <em>The Cat</em> placed you directly in the shit and made you understand someone else's position by placing you inside it. <em>The End</em> takes an extremely difficult subject, coats it with some low quality chocolate and a phenomenal candy shell, and it hopes you take the time to learn about the things it wants to teach. It's like your social studies teacher showing you a movie about Stalin but letting you play Game Boy at the same time, hoping you'll get sucked into the dictator's life.

Does it work? Maybe. It depends how conscientious the gamers playing it are. <em>The End</em> asks you, at the end of every level, an important question, such as “Do you believe people have the right to die?” You're given a yes or no choice, and when you make it you can click on a link allowing you access to more information about the topic, such as an explanation of the Japanese's beliefs on the subject.

The problem with this type of education is that I can just skip through the questions to get more candy. There's no consequence to your choices. The game's goal is to get the atheistic youth of Britain and the world to confront issues of death before they're thrust into those situations, but it does nothing to really engage in this respect. If I don't want to engage with death, I don't have to.

Where <em>The End</em> succeeds as a game, it fails as an educational game. This, obviously, isn't a terrible thing. It's a pretty fun platformer coupled with a severely entertaining card mini game, and that's nothing to sneeze at. On the other hand, the desire to play “one more level” almost certainly torpedoes its educational value—why would you read about death when there are horrible monsters to shame at a children's game of cards, or platforms to jump?  <em>The End</em>'s desire to be entertaining, ultimately, trumps its educational value.

Still, it's well worth a look.  It can be played <a href="http://playtheend.com/">here, in your very browser!</a>

*That's another show, how much I love stupid little mini games.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dark Soul&#039;s Exciting New Feature Is Called The &#039;Covenant&#039;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fans of the PS3 exclusive <em>Demon's Souls</em> will be pleased to learn that the difficulty level has not been toned down for its spiritual successor <em>Dark Souls</em>. The game promises to be a bigger and more polished dungeon crawler than <em>Demon's Souls</em> and will allow be available cross platform.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/dark-souls-exciting-new-feature-11587/dark-souls1/" rel="attachment wp-att-11588"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11588" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dark-souls1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki touched on a few interesting components on the upcoming title in an interview with G4.

<strong>"</strong>The very unique, indirect online system from<em> Demon’s Souls</em> is present in force here. You don’t really get to interact with other players, but you can see and learn from their experience. A new feature that will have a huge influence on things, however, is called the “covenant.” It’s a belief or pledge that players will be able to absorb, and it will help them determine what kind of role they want to play in the game and what sort of actions they want to take against other players and characters. It’s a bit hard to explain in words – perhaps it’s easier for players to simply experience and feel it. But it’s going to be a central aspect of the online play and will hopefully give players a new experience."

From the sound of things, <em>Dark Souls</em> promises to provide even more options to customize your character while maintaining the online features that made <em>Demon's Souls</em> such a success.

<em>Dark Souls</em> is scheduled to release on October 4th, 2011.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[EA realizes that over the next few months, game developers will be unleashing a barrage of blockbuster video games that will be fighting for your hard earned dollars. To separate the upcoming <em>Need For Speed The Run</em> from the rest of the herd, they recruited a couple of Sports Illustrated models to push the latest game in the franchise to the top of your list.

"Electronic Arts and Sports Illustrated are teaming up to include two sultry new adversaries in The Run. Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2011 cover model, Irina Shayk, and featured Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2011 model, Christine Teigen, are heating up the competition and joining the race from San Francisco to New York."

http://youtu.be/vMjfyExwTd8

"Irina and Christine will be starring as best friends and professional racers Mila Belova and Nikki Blake, beautiful and ruthless competitors who will stop at nothing to reach New York City first and get their hands on the $25 million dollar prize. These two lethal ladies are sure to stand out from among the 200 skilled, vicious drivers Jack competes against in this illegal cross-country race."

<em>Need For Speed The Run</em> will be available on November 15<sup>th.</sup>

Earlier today, the internet was abuzz with reports regarding a British network's blunder in a documentary meant to showcase how the Libyan dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, supplied the IRA with weaponry in the 80's. Instead of using real footage, ITV network used a clip from the war simulator <em>Arma 2</em>. Undoubtedly, it was the kind of advertisement money can't buy for Arma, not so much for ITV.

James MacLeod, a spokesperson for the network, states that the fiasco  "was an unfortunate case of human error for which we apologize." He goes further and suggests that they are in possesion of <em>actual </em>footage of the 1968 attack the <em>Arma II</em> clip was meant to show, and that this would be edited onto their documentary soon. The previous video, however, has already been viewed 1.3 million times around the world.

		<title>Michele Bachmann&#039;s campaign to utilize Farmville</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/farmville1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11620" title="farmville1" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/farmville1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="375" /></a>

Over the last couple of months, the Bachmann campaign has explored social media options such as Facebook and Twitter to better target small, but specific demographics cheaply and efficiently. Bachmann's campaign claims that this strategy was what gave them a small edge in the Iowa Republican strawpoll earlier this year, though interestingly enough, she only won by about 150 votes.

Given their alleged success with the social media campaign, Bachmann is looking into launching a "gamification of politics" via the infamous Facebook game, Farmville. The project will allow players to get involved with politics in-game,by introducing doorknocking for political candidates on other player's farms, and allowing players to place yard signs ion their lawns. The software is slated to release sometime later this year, though we're curious if it will actually be successful given that the numbers suggest it's doubtful that their social media campaign actually made any difference.

<p style="text-align: justify">Ah...the Binding of Isaac, a story that's been scaring the bejeezus out of Sunday school students for centuries. For those unfamiliar with the Biblical tale, ol’ Bob’s interpretation above pretty much boils the whole thing down to bare bones: No matter the cost, God’s will must be obeyed. But if that isn't thorough enough for you (or filled with enough cyborg eye powerups), perhaps you'll just have to go ahead and zip on over to Steam, where you'll find Edmund McMillen's (of <em>Super Meat Boy</em> fame) fresh take on the classic scare-tactic, the aptly-titled <em>The Binding of Isaac, </em>available today. Packed with enough material to withstand dozens of playthroughs, including multiple endings, <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is in spite of its flaws a game that will keep you coming back for more. It's sure as hell worth five dollars.</p>


[caption id="attachment_11694" align="aligncenter" width="477" caption="This is actually about as un-terrifying as the enemies get."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/the-binding-of-isaac-%e2%80%93-pc-game-review-11628/isaactwo/" rel="attachment wp-att-11694"><img class="size-full wp-image-11694" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IsaacTWO.jpg" alt="" width="477" height="358" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">"Hell" is probably a good place to start actually. Though McMillen likely had other intentions, <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>is ultimately the story of a boy embracing damnation to escape reverence. While the biblical, B.C.E. Isaac voluntarily sacrificed himself in order to honor God's will, McMillen’s Isaac just ain't having it: upon seeing his mother knife-in-hand, he leaps into a previously-unseen hatchway that leads to the “basement”—an underground lair crawling with wave after wave of demented creatures and mutilated children. In other words: for his derision, Isaac is sentenced to wander hell alone. It is in this way that we might view <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> as a criticism of the post-self esteem movement culture's contempt of authority, and the gameplay as our "punishment."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But I have to say it's a pretty wonderful punishment...By combining  elements of the rougelike with the monster-busting, item-earning of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, each playthrough of McMillen's new game will be both unexpected and rewarding. And it'll occasionally even be a little frightening. Though I must warn you: in classic rougelike fashion, <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> permadeath...dying will <span style="text-decoration: underline">always</span> mean starting anew back at the first dungeon. In an effort of ensuring that the levels don't get stale, each dungeon is generated randomly at the onset of a playthrough, meaning that you'll never encounter the same game twice. Though there are core rooms that will always serve the same purpose (treasure; boss; shop; secret room), their rewards, dangers, and surprises will always be random.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And I assure you, this is a game that has plenty of surprises in store: With a selection of over one thousand pre-designed rooms (including Arcade, Challenge, and Mystery rooms), thirty-six randomly dropped Tarot Card and Pill variations that grant special abilities, numerous stackable items and stat boosts that both alter Isaac's appearance and change the way the game is played, as well as a host of Familiars that will follow and assist the player, McMillen has built a game that makes permadeath a sort of reward in and of itself. And as is often the case in these roguelike games, the degree to which the environments change from one game to a next will make or break the game. Now into my second dozen playthroughs of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, I'm happy to report that its appeal is still as strong as it was in the first dozen. Additionally, replaying unlocks new classes, each with his or her own distinct skills and attributes. This will allow players looking to experiment as well as those simply seeking more of a challenge (and I'm not sure why you would, as the game is punishingly difficult already) to tackle the legions of squirming, gross monsters in ways better suited to the individual's tastes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Adding to this sheer difficulty is—at least for this player—the lack of joystick support. Technically a twin-stick shooter ("technically" in that I have buttons instead of sticks), and a fast-paced one at that, I often found myself frustrated trying to get Isaac to shoot where I wanted him to. Perhaps the fault lies in my lackluster skills. Otherwise, Isaac moves not unlike Meat Boy, with a bit of glide to him, allowing you to maneuver him through some pretty tight spots. Get yourself in a corner with these enemies, especially since they will sporadically spawn new abilities, and you'll be glad that the time spent not adding joystick support at least went into carefully refining the physics of Isaac's movement.</p>

One-half a NIN song."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/the-binding-of-isaac-%e2%80%93-pc-game-review-11628/isaacfour/" rel="attachment wp-att-11695"><img class=" " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IsaacFOUR.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="357" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: justify">Anyone who's familiar with McMillen's previous work (<em><em></em>Aether</em>, for instance) will know that he strives to bring a coherent and unique art style to each of his games, and <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is no exception. But that's not saying the game is "pretty"—this go-round McMillen has constrained himself with a stringent palette of earth tones; be prepared to see plenty of grays, browns, and ruddy reds. This stylistic choice of muted, drab backdrops is, however, nicely contrasted against an assortment of brightly-colored and deeply-inked characters, enemies, and items, establishing a sharp dichotomy between the immutable, labyrinthine setting and the often-multihued, sometimes-rich presence of those that inhabit it. Moreover, this choice seems to emphasize the gameplay itself: that which quits moving will quickly become dust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Danny Baranowsky's soundtrack falls into the "keep moving" category: ranging from suspenseful and eerie to raucous and occasionally bombastic, often within the span of the same track, musically <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is pretty schizophrenic. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though it is a 180 from his <em>Super Meat Boy</em> work.  And yet, what the soundtrack lacks in toe-tapping it makes up for in haunting, lurking rhythms, even if they too frequently devolve into the middling faux-metal. Still, even in this there are surprises to be had: a particular standout is the final boss theme of the game, which tweaks the metal-symphony formula with an expertly placed undercurrent of pulsing synth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Overlooking these minor flaws, what we're left with is a fresh and enjoyable take on an old tale, complete with a new kind “binding”—instead of being bound by rope, McMillen's Isaac is bound by irreverence, as he literally descends deeper and deeper into a world of urine powerups, blood-crying children, and, yes, quite a bit of poop. It's a new Binding of Isaac for a new, boldly-flippant generation...and honestly, if something as fresh and unique as <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is what irreverence has to offer, I don't see that changing anytime soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Less is more: Fez&#039;s subtractive design influenced by Ico </title>

<em>Fez</em>, the game we're not completely convinced will actually Ever Exist, was heavily influenced by Fumito Ueda's "Design by Subtraction" paradigm; the same design which has vaulted both <em>Ico</em> and <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/why-shadow-of-the-colossus-is-overrated-11555/"><em>Shadow of the Collossus</em> </a>to fame.  Phil Fish of Polytron credits the design for creating a lean and focused game. Before this, there were many different superflous elements such as weights, switches, even health, death and heart pieces much like <em>Zelda</em>. The game even lacks enemies, which is unusual for most platformers. So, what's the reason for these design choices? Fez is going for a sense of loneliness, much like Ico.

"<em></em><em></em>From <em>Ico</em>, I wanted to replicate that feel of a nostalgic, lonely isolation. Contemplative... quiet. The game is slow and there's not much more to it beyond the rotation mechanics; without enemies or combat, it's really about walking around and smelling the flowers. We decided on no enemies very early."

Aside from this, the design choices presented a challenge when constructing Fez, the challenge being creating a game "without having to resort to the established mechanics that you take for granted."

		<title>The Cole Train isn&#039;t a stereotype says Cliff Bleszinski</title>

It's not uncommon to hear <em>Gears</em> referred to as a hodgepodge of racial stereotypes, especially when speaking of the boisterous Augustus "Cole Train" Cole. Cliff Bleszinski, lead designer behind Gears 3, takes exception to that thinking, though--Cole isn't a stereotype at all, he says.

"And those of you citing Cole as some bad stereotype - guys, that's just Lester being Lester. We introduced Jace as a more laid back character as a contrast to Cole's enthusiasm (which, after playing his sequence, is his way of overcompensating for not being the centre of the universe and having to risk his neck for a can of beans now along with some aches and pains)."

Lester Speight, for those of you that don't know, is the voice actor and inspiration behind the Cole Train. Speight used to be a football player for Morgan State University, who is especially famed for his hilarious Terry Tate commercials for Reebok.

Personally, I'm not particularly concerned over whether Cole is a stereotype inasmuch as I am concerned about his mental health, if the Thrashball section of<em> Gears 3</em> is anything to go by.

Fun. Any of the writers here at Nightmare Mode will tell you that we have a serious problem with that word. <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2010/08/fun-factors-catalog.html">It could mean <em>anything</em></a>, and yet it's often considered the most important metric when judging games. Aside from this, we here at Nightmare Mode are of the belief that games should--on occasion, at least--aim to be more than just "fun."

In an interview with Develop, David Cage has proven to be like-minded in regards to our philosophy when it comes to the idea of 'fun.'

"What gets me upset is when people say videogames should just be fun. Fun? What does that even mean?," he asks. He applauds his latest game for bucking the trend, too. "I’m delighted that Heavy Rain is in no way ‘fun’ in the classic game sense."

Cage further critiques the industry by saying that "The problem is that everyone’s doing the same thing. This is the industry; racing, shooting, jumping....My thoughts are, what about adults, what about all the people who don’t play because they have no interest in shooting other people. We’re pushing the whole market into a niche."

This notion goes against the commonly touted belief that video games have become mainstream. Cage doesn't believe that games, for the most part, have actually become mainstream.  "You’re not mainstream, you’re a niche. You’re a very small niche. You are nothing. Look at Farmville. Look at Wii Fit. They’re both closer to being mainstream."

I suspect that most people will have major issue with those statements, if only because of how strongly the community pushes against the "casual" market and the industry around it.

Although I was expecting a bit more depth on your article I liked very much what you say here.

And even surprises me a little the way you say it so (hm) 'carefully' about the subject, I always had the impression that ok, huge majority aims for the fun factor, but many games (mostly independent or almost there) seems to [want to] achieve more than that.

Maybe it's because I'm really a fan of these kinds (loved HR btw) since I was a kid. No-purpose bashing and killing  and running never were my things before and now.. I must say I played 80-90% of mainstream games 10 years ago, now not even 20%, you just get tired of seeing same thing all the time - but I guess it's the same thing with life overall.

Nice article.]]></wp:comment_content>

Although I was expecting a bit more depth on your article I liked very much what you say here.

And even surprises me a little the way you say it so (hm) 'carefully' about the subject, I always had the impression that ok, huge majority aims for the fun factor, but many games (mostly independent or almost there) seems to [want to] achieve more than that.

Maybe it's because I'm really a fan of these kinds (loved HR btw) since I was a kid. No-purpose bashing and killing  and running never were my things before and now.. I must say I played 80-90% of mainstream games 10 years ago, now not even 20%, you just get tired of seeing same thing all the time - but I guess it's the same thing with life overall.

Also, while it is still very true that "mainstream" games are niche in the grand stream of things, it's not because of their content, not because they're not "adult" enough, but rather because the nature of games make them harder for adults to pick up and be interested in. The gaming industry is still very young, only a small portion of the population has grown up with them. For those that haven't there is a large barrier to entry other than subject matter. It's simply difficult to make an adult care to learn how to play. Suffice to say, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Now, as the gaming population ages and (hopefully) matures, more adult themed games will start finding success. It's already happening in fact; just look at L.A. Noire, Catherine, and Heavy Rain. So sure, right now it's a small niche, but the industry is still growing up. Just as peoples interests broaden as they age, so too will the games.]]></wp:comment_content>

A better word would be engaging. Think of it this way. You're in a room with another person which you don't know and start talking about mundane things... politics, weather, sports. You are talking, but you are not engaged in the conversation. The moment a common passion comes up or a point of debate, we get engaged.

Same goes for video games. A game is good if it is 'engaging' for the player.

I might be engaged by swinging my Power Sword around in Space Marine and causing immense amounts of havoc, but i can also be engaged the moment i am challenged to survive by breaking outside the rules of the game in Portal.

Being engaged and thus 'challenged' in one way or another is what games should strive for... For those particular moments where we go 'oh wow'. Sadly, calling this 'fun' causes a disfavor to the media as a whole.]]></wp:comment_content>

It’s not a full-fledged “pay whatever and get five great indie games at once” offer, but it’s still pretty good. Right now you can head on over to the <a href="//www.humblebundle.com/”">Humble Indie Bundle</a> website and get <i>Frozen Synapse</i>(soundtrack also included) for any amount of money you want.

However, if you pay more than the average, which at the time of this writing is $4.36, then you get the previous Frozenbyte bundle for free. The Frozenbyte bundle includes <i>Trine, Shadowgrounds Survivor, Shadowgrounds, Jack Claw,</i> and <i>Splot</i>.

Money goes to either the bundle, a charity of your choice, or the developers. You set who gets what, and how much they get. The offer lasts for about two weeks, so jump on it while you can.

Great cause, great price, great games. What more could you want?

Jonathan Blow was recently interviewed by Edge magazine to talk about his new game, <em>The Witness</em>, and he expressed his thoughts on open world games.

"I think games tend to try and tightly control what the player sees and does. So I wanted to take a different approach to that," says Blow when discussing the amount of freedom players will have in <em>The Witness</em>. The free-romaing puzzle game has players wandering around an uninhabited island. According to Blow, the player will have a surprising amount of freedom being able to reach the end of the game without solving all of the puzzles. This gives him the freedom to make them extra hard, allowing frustrated players to move on. The game will feature no NPCs and rely purely on player curiosity rather than yellow exclamation points over stangers' heads.

"If you play a linear game where you pick up a key and then get to a door and use the key in the door, then the door might as well not be there." By golly do I agree with that statement. <em>The Witness</em> is tentatively scheduled for release next year on Windows, Xbox 360, and PS3. I'll be keeping an eye on this one.

Good news, fans of anime and JRPGs. It's been confirmed that<em> PERSONA 4 the Animation</em> will soon be headed to the western hemisphere. Houston-based licensing company, Sentai Filmworks, have announced that they will be picking up and distributing the 25 episode series based on the stellar Persona game of the same name.

The anime is helmed by Seiji Kishi, director of other hit series<em> Raagnorok the Animation</em> and <em>Angel Beats!</em>, while Yuuko Kakihara of <em>Stitch!</em> and <em>Heaven’s Lost Property</em> fame will handle script supervision. It's set to follow the newly renamed Yu Narukami and his band of friends as they try to resolve an ongoing series of mysterious murders, closely following the same story established in the game.

While no release date has been set in the west, the series is scheduled to broadcast on Japan's MBS network on October 6, with Sentai Filmworks confirming digital distribution methods will begin soon afterwards and a planned DVD and Blu-Ray release scheduled for sometime 2012.

		<title>Valve Want Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to be the Definitive Version</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/valve-want-counter-strike-global-offensive-to-be-the-definitive-version-11764/csgoscreen/" rel="attachment wp-att-11766"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11766" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CSGOSCREEN-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

Over a decade after its release, <em>Counter-Strike</em> is still the most played game on Steam. As of this writing, there are 57,000 people playing the<em> 1.6</em> iteration of the game, while <em>Counter-Strike: Source</em> comes in at a close third behind <em>Team Fortress 2</em> with 51,000. Not bad for a game that even Valve's own Chet Faliszek says "looks like shit."

With <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, </em>a streamlined update of the series set to drop early next year, Faliszek sat down with Develop to discuss eSports, Steamworks and the developer's move in to consoles.

"With <em>Global Offensive</em>, we’re making it to be the best version of <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and the one that people should be playing – but we can’t force that. We need to talk with those players and try to understand their concerns," he said.

"One of the ways to do that is with better graphics. 1.6 looks like shit, right? I don’t think there’s anyone who thinks it looks good anymore. It’s a sign of the times - if you want to see the community grow we’re going to have to up the graphics. Both sets of pros would love to see a game that sponsors would see as the definitive version so they can have bigger tournaments."

Like <em>Portal 2</em>, <em>CS:GO</em> will be a tri-platform release, marking the series' first appearance on the Playstation. Like <em>Portal 2</em> again, the PS3 version will come with Steamworks integration, and maybe even cross-platform play.

"We’re looking at [cross-platform play]. It’s something that we’ll find out during the beta. We don't want to hamstring one platform to another. So we’ll start the beta on PC and then at the end of that we’ll give it over to the 360 players, because we just don’t have that ability to do incremental updates and things like that on the 360."

When asked about Steamworks on the Xbox 360, Faliszek was optimistic - at least when you consider the rocky relationship between Microsoft and Valve that keeps<em> Team Fortress 2</em> vanilla.

"Maybe, we’ll see. That’s something Microsoft will has to decide. There’s some things going on with<em> Portal 2</em> right now, but we’ll see."

Detroit, 2027 AD. You are Adam Jensen. An ex-SWAT operative, now head of security at Sarif Industries--A biomedical augmentation manufacturer central to the game’s primary conflict. A group of terrorists have attacked the company you work for, murdered the woman you love, and damaged you to the point where drastic measures have been taken to save your life. It’s this encounter that sets the stage for the newest entry, and prequel, in the much beloved<em> Deus Ex</em> franchise. Naturally, expectations have set the bar quite high, but has Eidos Montreal delivered?
<div style="text-align: center">***</div>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/10/deus-ex-human-revolution-review-11431/deus-ex-human-revolution-adam-jensen/" rel="attachment wp-att-11434"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11434" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Deus-Ex-Human-Revolution-adam-jensen.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="357" /></a><em></em></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>“There is no right or wrong. Just the consequences of your actions.” </em></p>
The story is centered around an ongoing civil rights battle between the haves and have-nots, with human naturalists opposing augmentation enhancement that eerily echoes the anti-science conservative movement present in America today. However, unlike current day tea partiers, Eidos have given a sense of legitimacy to the Humanity Front. From Neuropozyne dependency to government control, not everything is better on the side of technology in the world of <em>Deus Ex</em>, and it’s this balancing act that’s at the heart of the game’s story. Who is good and who is bad? Both sides fight for a reasonable cause that’s easy to sympathize with, situated in a moral gray area where neither answer is entirely right or wrong.

It’s in this world you find yourself. As Adam Jensen, you’re tasked with 2 primary goals: investigating the aforementioned conflict resulting in the death of your beloved and protecting the company you work for. The former taking a backseat to the latter until it suits Sarif’s interests. As Sarif’s lapdog, you’re often given questionable tasks throughout the game. Like, say, prioritizing the safety of a weapon prototype instead of the lives of several hostages. Despite being your employer, the game rarely gives you a feeling of security around him. You’re often fed misinformation or half-truths, leading you to feel uneasy about your own actions.

And Sarif’s not the only one looking out for his own interests. From rival augmentation manufacturers and humanitarian groups to news corporations and government organizations, it seems everyone has an angle to play in <em>Deus Ex</em>, and you’re simply one of their pawns. It frames the game’s neo-noir aesthetic perfectly, really making you question every action you take and motivating you to investigate further.

Thankfully, Jensen has the means to do so. While he definitely has his own personality, there’s enough player choice for you to impose your will on him throughout the game on one of it’s many key issues, and what wonderful choices they are. No matter how you’ve decided to play the game, none of them are too far out of character. All your options feel very natural and appropriate for Jensen’s personality, despite the vast differences between your choices. Likewise, it’s often difficult to discern the “right” choice in many circumstances, once again playing to the game’s strength of moral ambiguity. It’s an interesting dynamic that works well, and is a wonderful change of pace from the clear-cut “good vs bad” karma systems present in so many games today. You choose what you want to, not what the game tells you is an inherently good or bad option.

That same choice can also be applied to much of your interactions in the game. <em>Deus Ex</em> does a wonderful job at creating the illusion that you can truly do whatever you please. I can clearly remember the moment that hit me. The first mission in the game after you receive your augments, an officer wouldn’t talk to me with my weapon pulled out. Annoyed, I pointed the gun at his temple and pulled the trigger. Much to my surprise, blood splattered across the wall and he fell to the ground. “Holy shit!”, I thought. “I can actually kill the good guys!”, before his fellow police members proceeded to fill me with hot lead. And you can! Nearly every entity that you come across in the game, good or bad, can be killed; much to my delight, as I left a breadcrumb trail of corpses around town so that I could find my way back to certain areas. No one respawns. Death is absolute, sending the player a really strong message about the consequences of his or her actions. This illusion, however, is shattered during the few moments of the game when you encounter the half-dozen or so individuals who can’t be killed for the sake of story progression. Still, they’re few and far between, and you’ll likely be astounded at the freedom you’re given and how vulnerable even the most important characters in the game are.

Among those who’re invincible are the game's supporting cast that propel the story forward. Much like Jensen, these characters are fleshed out and well realized, once again adding to the genuine tone of the game, making you feel like you’re in a world that really exists. From your begrudging coworker, Francis Pritchard, to your antagonistic relationship with your boss, David Sarif, and his orders, the game surrounds you with believable characters from the onset and continues to develop them throughout the course of the game. William Taggart goes from being your primary antagonist to a sympathetic, albeit misguided, individual who fights for a reasonable cause. Meanwhile, Pritchard evolves from being a prick, to a reluctant friend willing to help you out. And it’s your relationship with Faridah Malik that’s particularly warming. What starts as nothing more than idle chitchat between missions slowly transforms into a close relationship between two people who’ve been through a lot together.

It’s regrettable, then, that some of the believability of this cast is marred not by poor writing or development, but the game’s presentation. Voice acting ranges anywhere from decent to God awful--especially any character with an accent--while the animations are jittery, almost as though the entire cast has Parkinson's. To top it off, the character models dive right into the uncanny valley with soulless eyes and botoxed faces. While it’s not enough to take away from what the writing has accomplished, it certainly presents the story in an awkward manner that makes it more difficult to appreciate.

Nevertheless, it gets the job done, and it's decent enough to keep the game's story progressing, developing even more emotional conflicts and delving even deeper into a number of complex issues with real world analogs. One particular level is incredibly striking in this respect. It has you navigate through the offices of an abandoned news station, unaware of what's happened. As you explore, you'll uncover a number of documents and emails detailing the vast corruption within the company, being paid off to alter the news, and employees emotionally torn between their job requirements and their own moral code, further establishing this dichotomy present throughout the game. It's fantastic, and you'll continue to experience it throughout most of the game.

Roughly two-thirds the way through, this balance starts to fall apart. There's a noticeable change as the game becomes  less of a detective story and more of a "man on a mission" as Adam Jensen's primary concern shifts to saving the princess rather than the goals he'd previously been working towards. It's a gradual transformation, and one that's tied to the story thus far, but despite establishing a motive, it's still a poor direction to go in. It's also around this time that the game's very plausible story that's strongly grounded to reality, turns more towards fantasy conspiracy nonsense standard in your typical videogame script. It's incredibly disheartening to say the least; to have what started as one of gaming's strongest stories fall into bed with an assortment of clichés and tropes.  And it's even worse when you realize that much of this nonsense is strictly there to tie the story together with the original <em>Deus Ex</em>. It sounds like such a blasphemous statement to make: To blame one of the most acclaimed PC games of all times for being the primary downfall of it's successor, but I can think of no other reason why an otherwise superb story suddenly shifts to nonsense explanations as a means to tie the story together, other than the fact that such absurdity was a quintessential staple of previous entries in the series.

Sadly, the game's story continues to nosedive after this point, spiraling out of control and unraveling nearly everything the earlier half of the story worked so hard to establish, before finally hitting rock bottom by the end of the game. The moral gray area is demolished when the game makes it quite clear which side it agrees with, completely alienating everyone who has a different point of view. Ambiguity is also off the table when the bad guy not only becomes clearly defined, but is an absolutely ridiculous evil genius caricature. It makes you question why they even tried so hard to establish these traits so early in the game when they serve no purpose in the game's finale.

Never before have I seen such an otherwise phenomenal game completely drop the ball in the last act. Again, it's not that the last part of the game particularly terrible, objectively speaking. If you're familiar with most videogame stories, this sort of ridiculousness is par for the course. But I cannot stress enough just <em>how damn good</em> the initial two-thirds of this game is. So when it suddenly shifts from a transcendent gaming experience to something befitting of a <em>Call of Duty</em> title, you can't help but wonder what happened.

<p style="text-align: center"> <em>“For the first time in history, we have a chance to steal fire from the gods."</em></p>
Choice is the name of the game with Human Revolution, and it’s sure to offer you plenty of it. From the wide, sweeping locales to intricate personal conversations, the game has crafted scenarios that truly let you play to your liking. The game is centered around two primary hub cities--Detroit and Hengsha--as well as a handful of one-time areas for specific missions. While you’ll find it incredibly easy to get lost in these locales, it's surely not a bad thing. From sewers to back alleys and rooftops, the game’s locations are absolutely littered with multiple paths to your objectives and hidden secrets to uncover; often leading you to a region you’ve never been, causing you to question your own whereabouts. While the areas aren’t particularly large (comparatively speaking to other sandbox games), it’s these layers and depth for you to explore that add a real sense of legitimacy to the world.

Such design compliments the gameplay nicely, allowing you to undertake missions in a variety of different ways. From straightforward firefights to sneaking through the backdoor, every area has been designed to supplement your preferred approach, right down to itemization. Blasting your way through the main entrance will net you plenty of ammo off the guards, whereas tranquilizer rounds and energy bars are more commonly found hidden away in storage closets, and hacking will supply you with a healthy amount of nuke and stop software. It’s cleverly itemized to give you just enough to continue, but never so much that your task becomes easy. Some would call this being stingy. I call it smart design.

In addition, the game is quick to reward those with a keen eye or walk off the beaten path. Exploration is rewarded in droves and not just in the way of new approaches: From silly easter eggs to weapon caches to data pads and pocket secretaries with loads of useful information, the game has a lot to offer for those who stop and look around rather than rushing straight to the next objective. Want a rocket launcher your second mission into the game? Well, if you know where to look, it's certainly a possibility. Not since Oblivion have I seen a game reward gratuitous exploration with such enthusiasm.

The combat itself is broken down into a few key components--namely lethal and non-lethal combat, stealth, and hacking. And while some would boil it down to action vs stealth, I feel that’s an unfair simplification. What makes <em>Deus Ex</em>’s combat so immensely satisfying is that it’s a grab bag of everything. A stealthy player is not confined to the shadows, nor is a brawler barred from hacking his way through a terminal. While you might opt to adhere strictly to one play style or the other, nothing is stopping you from taking a different approach. Each play style flows together like water and you can easily go from hiding behind a stack of boxes to an all out firefight in the snap of a finger. It’s incredibly satisfying and works amazingly well. And while the difference between lethal and non-lethal combat is much more subtle than the action and stealth dynamics-- mostly due to similarities in the mechanics--it definitely has a profound impact on <em>how</em> you play. It's a difficult concept to articulate in terms of gameplay, but it will certainly effect the choices and decisions you make as a player.

To complement the combat, Jensen has numerous upgrades at his disposal; both in the form of weapon upgrades to strengthen his firepower and augments to enhance his functionality. Gun upgrades are your standard affair: Reload speed, ammo capacity, and what have you. While not groundbreaking, it does reward you for staying true to certain guns since no weapon proficiencies have made their way into the game from the original<em> Deus Ex. </em> To give you further incentive to stick to certain pieces, you'll also get a few extra bonuses in the way of silencers, red dot lasers, enemy tracking, and some other knick knacks to personalize your preferred weapons. The limited inventory system also lends itself to this structure, punishing those who carry around a large arsenal with a lack of space to carry their other necessities.

Meanwhile, augments are true to their namesake, acting as talent points, allowing you to greatly enhance your various capabilities. For instance, while no augments are required to successfully stealth, it’s certainly a lot easier when you can move silently and cloak yourself from prying eyes. Unfortunately, much of their individuality is lost when they’re all within your gasp. While you might start the game as a super sleuth who’s vulnerable to confrontation, by the second half you’ll be overflowing with Praxis Points. Who needs to decide between recoil reduction and hacking capabilities when you can do it all? Why, by the end of the game, Adam Jensen is a veritable superhero of sorts, leaping 20 feet into the air, punching through walls, going invisible, and turning into a human grenade to destroy all those in his vicinity. It feels a bit like all roads lead to Rome, making earlier augment choices in the game seem redundant.

Speaking of redundant functions, one has to wonder, with the majority of combat taking place from a third person perspective, and the stealth gameplay’s obvious cues from Metal Gear Solid, why the first person point of view is even required. While it’s not a hindrance, it does feel rather arbitrary in that it adds so little to the game. Taking cover shifts perspectives to an intuitive third person angle, clearly acknowledging--and thankfully addressing--the shortcomings of a first person perspective. Meanwhile, most of the dynamic actions available take place in the form of a micro-cutscene. While it adds a small cinematic touch, it grows tiresome when you have to break the flow of the game to waste 10 seconds watching Jensen float down from a long fall for the hundredth time. One has to wonder if the first person camera is nothing more than a legacy feature due to the franchise’s history as a FPS, when everything else is trying so hard to be a third person stealth/action game.

Caveats with the camera aside, there’s still a few complaints to be had. Namely, how cumbersome the energy system is. Only your initial energy cell refills while the second through fifth (provided you upgrade them) must all be refilled manually through the consumption of an energy bar. Unlike limiting your ammo, however, this doesn’t work in the game’s favor. It leaves you in one of two situations where you either have little to no energy and can’t take action, or you have infinite energy so long as you have items to refill it. Neither is favorable and could be avoided if they all refilled.

Likewise, your opponents could benefit from a bit of tweaking as well. Enemies in the game boil down into 3 main groups: light, medium, and heavy. While there are multiple varieties within these groups, ranging from robots to cloaked soldiers, the lack of any higher tiers to combat with make them feel like nothing more than cannon fodder by the end of the game (thanks in no small part to being Superman, as mentioned earlier). You’re sure to encounter a fair amount of diversity, but it matters little when even the strongest bad guys go down in a single headshot.

Lastly, when discussing the game's weaknesses, we cannot leave out the boss fights. Though they make up only a small fraction of the game, they are above and beyond the most disappointing aspect in respects to the gameplay. <em>Deus Ex</em> is a game whose biggest strength is diversity and player choice, but the boss fights completely strip away those elements that makes the game so amazing. What you're left with is a straightforward firefight that requires little to no skill and absolutely no alternative means to approach the battles. It's a shame, really. The boss battles could have been the crown jewel of the gameplay, really pushing the player's creativity to it's limits in a difficult and exhaustive one on one battles between wits. Instead, we're left with battles so unremarkable they blemish an otherwise superb game.

Still, even with it’s problems, <em>Deus Ex</em> plays amazingly well, blending together stealth, action, and exploration better than any game before it. Every action is rewarded and punished accordingly, and the flaws--aside from the boss fights--are easy to gloss over when you’re lost in the gameplay. With the game clocking in around 20 to 60 hours (depending on whether or not you adhere strictly to the primary missions or try to 100% the game), there's certainly a lot of content to make your way through, and the gameplay is more than engaging enough to keep you coming back without getting bored.

<div style="text-align: left">It would seem <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> has more in common with Icarus than it realizes. It’s an ambitious game, but one that flew too close to the sun. The story is one of the strongest this generation, until it becomes overly ambitious and instead becomes ridiculous. The gameplay is superb, but marred by a numerous small issues. It’s a shame, really. In most cases, when you sense that a game could have been much better than it was,  it’s a mediocre game that had many promising features that were broken or not fully realized. That's not the case here though. <em>Deus Ex</em> is undoubtedly, even with it’s problems, a fantastic game. It’s just a shame that it had the potential to be one of the best this generation, but didn’t quite reach it. Just as it started to ascend to greatness, it's wings melted and it fell back to earth.</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you were one of the 1.5 million Playstation 3 users that had the chance to play the <em>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</em> beta this summer, you may have noticed that the developers have put a stronger emphasis on hand to hand combat. A recent interview with the game's co-lead designer Richard Lemarchand says that this was a conscious decision by the Naughty Dog team.

"With this game we decided to switch things up a little bit, and it has seen us shift the focus we have on the different elements of the gameplay. We've been talking about the way we've put an increased focus on the fist fighting in the game, because that's an important part of pulp adventure. Most of the great pulp heroes are two-fisted sluggers. That gave us a great opportunity to try some new things in terms of game mechanics."

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/uncharted-3-to-focus-on-fist-fighting-and-characterization-11774/uncharted-3d/" rel="attachment wp-att-11781"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11781" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uncharted-3d-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

The <em>Uncharted</em> titles have never fit into any particular genre because they offer the player a wide variety of gameplay. While the largest portion of the pie is comprised of shooting, the developers have integrated platforming, cut scenes, brawling, and puzzle solving to keep each segment of the story fresh. Even though the gun fights are top notch, the fist fights offer a rare back and forth experience that never grows old. Improving on the stealth takedowns of games like <em>Splinter Cell</em> and <em>Metal Gear</em>, <em>Uncharted 3</em> has implemented a variety of realistic animations to aid Nathan Drake in his adventures.
<div>

The fluid combat system truly shines when the character is climbing, dangling and swinging from the many interactive parts of the environment. Few games offer this variety of non-shooting violence in such an effective and engaging manner.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11776" style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uncharted3a-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" />Although gameplay of <em>Uncharted 3</em> will ensure its prominence in the online multiplayer world, the cinematic experience of the story is what sets the title apart from the competition. Lemarchand has seen the success that the indie scene has achieved with a limited budget and an out-of-the-box mentality and is wise enough to appreciate their achievements.
<div>

"I do think we are reaching a stage where the creative, where the ideas behind video games and the emotions you can evoke with video games are really coming to the fore. I'm interested in the indie scene and the art game scene, because I see it as the active avant-garde of video games."

"Indie games and art games are going to have a big impact on the mainstream of video gaming in terms of bringing new ideas to the table and demonstrating different things are possible both emotionally and also in the realm of game design."

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/uncharted-3-to-focus-on-fist-fighting-and-characterization-11774/uncharted-3c/" rel="attachment wp-att-11779"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11779" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uncharted-3c-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

Like any good movie, what usually makes or breaks a good story is the strength of the characters. Drake and his friends have a distinct personality and presentation that even the most casual fans of <em>Uncharted</em> will immediately recognize. There's a reason why gaming sites were running headlines of "Wedding Ring Spotted on Elena" and "Fans Demand More Victor Sullivan" in anticipation of November's release. Naughty Dog has achieved a rare feat by creating characters that gamers will emotionally invest in.

"We have said many times we went into the Uncharted series considering many video games are plot driven; the machinations of a space empire, or the fighting of dynasties in a fantasy kingdom drive the plot of many video games. That's all well and good, but we saw an opportunity to drive the story forward with characters and the interactions between the characters, and that implies they have to have meaningful struggles with each other and meaningful relationships with each other. The love scenes have to be touching for you to really feel the love. The comedy has to make you laugh."

<em>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</em> will be released on November 1, 2011.

"Yeah. Yeah, it turns out gamers are not stupid, and I don't think we should treat them like they are. "

This is perhaps the best thing I've heard from anybody in the games industry recently. A recent interview with thatgamecompany's Kellee Santiago covers the developer's response to their growing fanbase, the debatable definition of "literate" gamers, and the importance of testing. It's refreshing to read an interview with an indie developer that doesn't pull the "holier than thou" attitude. You can read the whole thing <a href="http://indiegames.com/2011/09/thatgamecompany_industry_doesn.html">here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Surprised? I hope not. It's not as if we're continually inundated with sequels and franchises in this industry or anything.

In an interview with Eurogamer, the production coordinator for <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, Marce-Andre Dufort, revealed his thoughts on a possible <em>Deus Ex</em> sequel.

"I would like to, but I don't know what the future is right now. I know that Wada-san [Yoichi Wada, Square Enix president] said he had a plan for the future, but right now we're celebrating the success of the game, since it's the first game of the studio. I don't know if you've seen the credits of the main game, but there were a lot of production babies, so I think people want to spend some time with their families and take some time off. That's pretty much where we are right now."

Wada's plan for the future very well could be more DLC--Dufort is bullish on giving any details on that front, which just makes DLC seem more likely, no? Either way, it's probably safe to assume that it would be silly for Eidos not to take advantage of Human Revolution's success by...giving us more Deus Ex.

Here's <em>Wizorb</em>, in a nutshell: it's <em>Breakout</em>. And you hate <em>Breakout</em>.

What's that? You say you have fond memories of playing old-school <em>Breakout </em>in high school computer class? Yeah, so did I (well, I played <em>DX Ball</em>). Friend, so did I. Then I replayed it, in the form of <em>Wizorb</em>, and here we are now. It's got everything you “liked” back in high school, but it also has everything that made you swear loudly and get in trouble. <em>Wizorb</em> has a lot of charm, but deep down it doesn't have a lot to offer.

<em>Wizorb</em> casts you into the role of a half-wizard, half-ball creepy lech of an old wizard and tasks you with defeating evil and repairing the small town you happen to be in at the start of the game. You'll do this by playing<em> Breakout</em> without any real twists. You can cast some magic spells, but you get so few magic points that this is more of an added bonus than a feature. The spells you do have are mediocre and not of much use: the change direction spell is unreliable at best, the fireballs don't do much, and to use the fire ball power effectively the ball would have to go off the paddle in the proper direction, which is a 50-50 proposition in <em>Wizorb.</em> There are also enemies wandering the map, but these are nothing more than moving blocks who make the ball do wacky things with physics when they hit them.

It's all pretty standard stuff, in other words. The mechanics are basic.

In general, you need one of two things to succeed on XBLIG, an <a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2010/11/tempura-of-the-dead-review-3095/">eye-catching name </a>or great production values. <em>Wizorb</em> follows the latter route. The game looks so fantastic, sounds so fantastic that you get the distinct impression the developers spent most of their time making the thing look pretty instead of making it memorable. The spritework is fantasitc, and the titular wizard-orb's face when he wins a level is exquisite. The game is flat-out gorgeous. It's hard not to give it that.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wizorb_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11807" title="wizorb_2" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wizorb_2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="253" /></a>

The problem you'll keep coming back to is that this is <em>Breakout</em>. That's all it is, and <em>Breakout </em>has not aged well. <em>Wizorb</em> isn't even a particularly improved version; in fact, given its plurality of levels with rows of unbreakable blocks and “how the fuck is this possible?” shots, it's just as bad as the original. There're still twice as many blocks per level as there should be, and it's still immensely frustrating with one block left, except now you can doubly curse yourself for using up all your magic power, preventing you from using a fireball to end the situation quickly.

Put bluntly, this is a great looking game that tries nothing new of note, and thus would be hard to recommend even before we take into account that <em>Breakout</em> has aged terribly. It's got fantastic style, and it's a functional version of a classic, but I'd be hard pressed to find someone who wants to play<em> Breakout</em> on their television.]]></content:encoded>

You don't need to me tell you that Reptile being made of bugs and Shao Kahn transforming into a squealing hydra, while hilarious, proved to everyone in the 90's that Mortal Kombat films should not be made. Fast forward to now in a world where director Kevin Tancharoen has treated the internet to his unique vision of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> universe with the short film <em>Mortal Kombat: Rebirth </em>and its subsequent web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</em>. Warner Bros., current owner of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> brand, is impressed. So impressed, in fact, that they've given the talented director an opportunity to direct a brand new, full-length film for the fighting game franchise. New Line Cinema will be producing the film. Since the original purpose for <em>Rebirth </em>was supposed to be a pitch to Warner Bros. for such a project, I believe Tancharoen can now properly consider it a success.

Considering that Tancharoen likely owes some of the credit of his new film's existence to the damned-well deserved success of the recent <em>Mortal Kombat </em>reboot, it's likely that it won't be an exact full-length version of <em>Rebirth</em>. When working with a big studio like New Line Cinema, some pressure will be almost certainly be applied to make sure it appeals to more than just the fans of <em>Legacy </em>and <em>Rebirth. </em>That said, we can at least hope for a combination of the best of both worlds. To get a taste of Tancharoen's interesting take on the franchise, you can check out the concept trailer for <em>Rebirth </em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDKCwEjc6DA">here</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The term “freedom fighter” is a controversial one, depending on whose side they are on. But regardless of motivations, there’s something noble about it, isn’t there? Giving up their former ways of life to fight for a country, a cause or even an idea takes guts. They’ll be fighting against an enemy that’s better equipped, better trained and better fed than themselves. However, they’ve got one thing the enemy hasn’t. Determination and desperation. To reiterate the old cliché: they’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.

[caption id="attachment_11817" align="aligncenter" width="410" caption="Yes, oddly enough it was also released for Gamecube"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom_Fighters_Cover.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11817  " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom_Fighters_Cover.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="581" /></a>[/caption]

A quiet morning in New York – well, as quiet as they get – is interrupted as the Soviets decide to invade. For years they’ve slowly been eating up more and more of the world, and have been sitting quietly on the borders, waiting for an opportunity to show itself. In other words, Freedom Fighters (2003) is an exploration of what could have happened if the Cold War hadn’t been fairly balanced. The game was crafted by IO Interactive, who are otherwise most famous for their Hitman series, and infamous for their Kane &amp; Lynch series. Curiously, the developers had actually intended that the game was to take place in Russia during an American invasion, but this move was blocked by the distributor and, oddly, Wal-Mart.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom_fighters_machinegun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11818" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom_fighters_machinegun.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Understandably, this invasion catches a lot of people in the crossfire, notably two plumbers who sadly aren’t Mario and Luigi. Mario and Luigi, armed with rusty AK-47's, blasting their way through the Reds, raising the Star and Stripes to the top of the flag pole would have been indescribably awesome. Unfortunately, we must make do with brothers Chris and Troy, who find themselves in an anti-Communist activist’s apartment on the day of the attack. The Soviets naturally seek out the prominent activist early on in the attack, and in the ensuing chaos Troy is captured by the Soviets, as they find the apartment empty. Thus Chris, having hidden from them, has an excellent incentive for standing up against the invaders instead of complying. And with anti-communist organizations already in place, it doesn’t take long for a genuine resistance movement to be established.

Chris quickly marks himself as someone to be relied on. He slowly advances in the ranks and gets to lead more and more men into combat. The men and women he has to rely on in combat. Freedom Fighters wasn’t a game that emphasized the strength or foolhardy bravery of one man, but rather how good a leader he is. You only had a few basic commands – attack, defend, charge, etc. – at your disposal, but they were enough for the combat to still feel tactically challenging and fulfilling. And charging in all by yourself just wasn’t a possibility unless you find carrying your vital organs on the outside fashionable. Granted, the enemies weren’t exactly the sharpest bunch, but they could still quite easily swarm you.

And the missions you were sent on weren’t just a list of objectives that you had to follow point-by-point. You were given a choice in which missions you wished to go on first, all of which lead to a major plot-driven mission at the end. But the order you did these missions impacted how the rest played out. For example, destroying a helipad in one made sure you didn’t have to encounter any gunships in another. Admittedly, the choices couldn’t exactly be said to be that impactful or deep, but at least they gave you the illusion of choice. You felt like you were an active member of the resistance, not just someone who happened to know how to fire a gun without killing yourself. Most importantly, the missions felt realistic in their structure. There were very few that involved heading in, guns blazing and killing everything in sight, even though that was usually what happened. Instead you went on missions to disrupt communications, raid supplies, rescue captives etc., and you worked like a true guerilla army, making surgical strikes, and then retreating back to the sewers.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom_fighters_squad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11819" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom_fighters_squad.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="448" /></a>

Having the war set close to home rather than in some generic Middle Eastern or Russian village was attempted earlier this year by Homefront, a horribly mediocre experience for a variety of reasons. However, they both explore the same theme. What effect does an invasion have on the denizens of a country? It’s certainly something that can be described as a national trauma, when it’s on the scale of the Soviet invasion in Freedom Fighters and the North Korean invasion in Homefront. In these cases, the local culture is basically being slowly killed out as the invaders try to assimilate or even kill those who resist.

Homefront tried to show the human side of this, by having the player explore the places the Resistance was hiding in between combat sections, and with some rather blatant scenes that were desperately trying not to merely evoke an emotional response in the players, but rather punch them in the eyes until they force out the tears. Freedom Fighters still comes out as the stronger game in this regard, perhaps exactly because it doesn’t try to force a response from the player, but just shows it. There’s something almost heart-warming about seeing the sewers getting filled up with people as the Resistance gains support, thanks to your actions – alright, that may be a bit self-important.

So, for a hypothetical Freedom Fighters 2, what would need to be changed? Frankly, not a lot. The action is solid and intense, yet it doesn’t become too much of a shooting-fest. You’re still the underdog, and you’ll have to keep your wits with you if you want to make it through. And the story is sufficiently emotionally driven - without being overly sentimental – and has some interesting plot twists along the way. It might not be the most expertly written one, but it guides the player through the game and the theme gently. The game could certainly do with a technical update too, but that’s a minor complaint. After all, few games that don't rely on a particular art style in their visuals rarely look that good almost a decade after their release. What bugs me about Freedom Fighters is that the ending was left completely open. The Resistance takes back Manhattan and New York in a brilliant showdown, but what happens afterwards, as Chris asks. They’ve only managed to destroy a fraction of the Soviet army, and now they’ve definitely pissed them off too. If the game had ended on a sad note, say, a nuclear strike on New York, destroying everything the Resistance had worked for, that would have been fine. Instead, I just felt hollow after finishing the game. Sure, I could fill in the following events myself, but IO Interactive need to end Freedom Fighters’ story themselves.

And that’s the major challenge a sequel to Freedom Fighters would face. How could they retain the guerrilla feel if it would end in open warfare with the Soviet Union? That would nearly require them to discard all that made Freedom Fighters such an excellent game. Maybe that’s why there hasn’t been a sequel yet. Nobody knows how to continue the story without risking mediocrity.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I just have to say: this game has some of the best "battle music" of any game I've ever played. It was stuck in my head for YEARS.

The problem with a sequel, I fear, is that without changes it wouldn't be fresh. Freedom Fighters was ahead of its time, but since then squad-based shooters have become a lot more common (if not necessarily better) and the Red Dawn "Russia invades America for no sensible reason" thing is being done to death with Call of Duty and Bad Company. It would have been far more interesting from the original "American invading" concept, but the idea of America as imperialist is too true to be politically acceptable. 

Not really sure how they could jazz it up for a new generation; half of me thinks it should be more humorous, since the original was frankly ridiculous in its narrative and was best when it was lighter (beautiful dramatic music aside). The over-the-top Russian he-man general, for instance.

Shigeru Miyamoto has taken up sword and shield once again to talk about the latest Zelda game. This presentation of <em>Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em> has revealed the absolutely staggering amount of content and variety the game will feature. Some impressive uses of the way directional slicing of the sword is integrated into gameplay are demonstrated, including the ability to slice an opponent's shield.  I nearly spilled my coffee when I saw Link going <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> on a hairy boss monster. With all of the content shown, Miyamoto's statement that the game could last 50-100 hours seems to have merit. Although some familiar mechanics like the dual hookshots from <em>Twilight Princess</em> and shooting switches with the bow are present, it's pretty clear that this game is well beyond being just another <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. If nothing else, it's pretty amusing to watch Miyamoto mimic sheathing a sword using a WiiMote. He has declared that he considers <em>Skyward Sword</em> "amazing" and a true showcase to all 25 years of Zelda game development. After watching this video, I'm pleasantly surprised to say I'm beginning to get excited about this game.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/zeldanewspost2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11849" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/zeldanewspost2.png" alt="" width="460" height="256" /></a>

However, the most surprising Zelda news of today comes from Games Radar. A recent preview for<em> Skyward Sword</em> reveals that the game will include dialogue options. While one should not expect <em>Mass Effect</em> levels of complexity, this represents a huge departure from the norm for the series. I'm very, very happy to see that Nintendo is taking some risks and tweaking the (in my opinion) aging Zelda formula.

Battleblog #12 is out, and with it a wealth of new information on Battlefield 3's battlelog and the game's new Platoon feature. As described on the battleblog,  "A Platoon is essentially the classic concept of gaming clans, only taken to the next level of flexibility and social interaction."

On the outset, the features are pretty normal. You can create your platoon's name and emblem, while each platoon can house 100 players, and each player can be a member of up to 3 platoons. It's your standard fair, but nothing remarkable. Beyond that, however, is a feature rich network of statistics and information provided to you and your fellow platoon members that effects it's overall standing within the online community.

Everything you and your members do will have an impact on your platoon's rank, score, and stats--tracking not only your individual performance, but the collective performance of your entire platoon as well. To assist this, you're also given a breakdown of how well members are performing, along with the classes people are playing and who your most valuable players are.

In addition, there will also be a host of social features integrated into the battlelog to keep you connected to your fellow members and other platoons alike. Starting with your platoon's feed, it will provide you with information on match records, new members, internal chats, and the like to keep you informed on what's happening internally, while the battlelog will allow you find and locate platoons local to you, apply for membership, or fan them to follow their progress and achievements.

It certainly sounds like it will add another layer of depth to what's shaping up to be this holiday's must-have multiplayer title, giving you plenty of incentive to not only get into the multiplayer, but to get involved and work together with a community. With teamwork already being one of the series' hallmark traits, these beneficial features are more than a welcome addition to the series.

If you're lucky enough to be in the BF3 beta, then you'll be able to test out these new features at this very moment. As for the rest of us, 10/25 can't come soon enough.

</a>One of the hottest topics of discussion in the video games industry lately is the problem with publisher/developer relationships. Multi-game contracts, I.P. ownership, borderline extortion, unrealistic milestones, and other horror stories don't paint a pretty picture of this vital yet uncomfortable aspect of our favorite entertainment medium. Thankfully From Software doesn't have to worry about any black phantoms invading their offices and demanding ways for the game to appeal to the tween demographic. Namco Bandai's Kei Hirono, producer of <em>Dark Souls</em> recently explained to Gamasutra in an interview that he likes to stay out of the way.

"...we let devs do what they want. Every time we receive a build, we're actually surprised by the new aspects that have evolved. So our job is to deliver this game to you guys on time, so we'll do our best to do that, and make sure that a great game is delivered."

As if the unique online features and brutal, yet fair difficulty weren't enough of a departure from the norm, this news of a non-invasive publisher propels <em>Dark Souls</em> above and beyond the what we're used to seeing coming from the AAA games industry. Kei Hirano goes on to explain how exciting it is that <em>Demons Souls </em>and <em>Dark Souls</em> appeal to a worldwide market. This is a new experience for a company that mostly produces anime games. What's even more refreshing to hear is that they've embraced this possibility instead of writing off worldwide audiences as a happy accident that will increase import gains unlike some Japanese publishers I feel I don't need to name. Let's hope that Namco Bandai's relationship with From Software and drive to understand and appeal to worldwide audiences is a trend that will catch on in the video games industry. In a perfect world it already would have.

		<title>Capcom DRM is on a Case-by-Case Basis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BionicCommandoRearmed2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11866" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BionicCommandoRearmed2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="322" /></a>

On the Playstation Network, at least. Certain downloadable PSN titles from Capcom, most notably <em>Bionic Commando Rearmed 2</em> and <em>Final Fight: Double Impact</em>, require the user to be online at all times in order to play.

Speaking to <a href="//www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-09-30-capcom-undecided-about-psn-drm”">Eurogamer</a>, Capcom's U.S. vice president Christian Svensson said <em>”Sony has a form of network DRM that we have chosen to use on a couple of titles, really as much as an experiment as anything else, to see what the impact was.”</em>

As for the impact it had, Svensson says that it was “inconclusive”, and didn’t appear to hurt or help them. He added that for future releases, Capcom will be looking at it on a case-by-case basis.

Again, this is only for the PSN versions of their games, 360 owners don't have to worry about a thing.

So... Capcom, did you bother to wonder and investigate how it effects your customers? How they get locked out if for some reason your servers or PSN goes down, like it did earlier this year? The DRM doesn’t do anything good or bad for you Capcom, but it is 100% bad for the consumer. So please stop with this DRM. According to your data, you've got nothing to lose, and the customers have only positive things to gain. So remove it, stop using it, and stop giving the people who are actually paying for the game the worse product.

Nathan Drake couldn't hunt down priceless treasures without his chicken bacon ranch on Italian herbs and cheese with a Dr. Pepper! Okay that's what I get at Subway, but I'm sure the dude raider has his own favorite sandwich configuration. Perhaps as a not-so-subtle ploy to get gamers to eat moderately more healthy food, Subway has partnered with Naughty Dog to give anyone who purchases a 30oz drink access to <em>Uncharted 3's</em> final multiplayer beta. The promotion will last through October, leading up to the game's release on November 1st. Taking part in the beta will net you the privilage of carrying over any experience you gain in that month into the final game along with some perks detailed in this <del>impossible to embed</del> <a href="http://www.viddler.com/sceablog/videos/2160/">video</a>.

Via email interview with USA Today, Ginger Kraus of Sony marketing alliances provided some insight on what led to their partnership with Subway.

"Subway saw the cinematic strength of the IP and we saw reach that would allow us to extend beyond our core demographic. This allowed us to support our goal to see the <em>Uncharted 3</em> multiplayer experience as one that was designed to empower every type of gamer – and that reach became very advantageous for this particular program."

Robert Cogburn of Naughty Dog was also interviewed and detailed some of the changes that have been made since the previous beta.

"Soon after the beta went live there were a number of complaints about controls and one consistent complaint was sprint. So, after a deep discussion about how to handle certain cases where turning on a dime just should not occur, we removed the control from sprint and made it flexible. When we had playtest with people who had played the beta, they often mentioned how much better sprint felt – progress!"

He also wanted to mention that the Dogs (yes, the developers) will be playing the beta as well. So get on there and see if you can beat them at their own game!

Hey guys!  Remember this old running feature, the Omnitopic?  Of course you don't—it's been a couple months and you're a busy person.  Well, it's back, with a new topic for all of us to debate until our fingers bleed from writing: downloadable content.

I know, I know, a physical, real topic as opposed to the hypothetical, analytical ideas we've talked about in the past.  Whatever will we say about it when we can't wag our fingers and analyze away?  Well, I imagine at least one someone will be pro-DLC, and another will be against DLC, and someone will write an article about downloading physical copies of games or movies and then placing them into the Playstation in their chest cavity.  But I could be wrong.

So, prepare for a month of posts about downloadable content and other things unrelated!  And a question: what do you, fairest reader, think of it?  Do you enjoy spending three dollars to download a set of horse armor, or would you rather buy anything else?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>10 tips and tricks to become a better Gears of War 3 player</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/carmine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11911" title="carmine" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/carmine-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="328" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To celebrate my recent, and most likely temporary, inauguration into the <a href="http://i52.tinypic.com/2jachf6.jpg">top 100 ranked King of the Hill in Gears of War 3</a>, I thought I’d share some tips on how to become a better Gears player. I note that a good deal of players online don’t do very basic things which could make their life easier, so hopefully even you Gearheads learn a thing or two from these pointers!
<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. Get comfortable with your starting weapons</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gears of War 3 is no longer a single-gun game; you have options available to you. There are six options for starting weapons, each one favoring a different type of playstyle. You need to figure out what you’re most comfortable with. Here’s a general guideline.</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Retro lancer:</span> high power at close range. Accuracy is difficult with the recoil, but that can be mitigated through fanning/bursting. One clip is capable of downing nearly an entire enemy team when active. Retro charge great for destroying people hiding behind corners. Best for players who value power and who like close-range warfare.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Lancer:</span> medium power, fantastic at long range, very accurate. With it’s instant kill, the chainsaw, though risky, can be a great tool in the right hands. The lancer can be used as a general annoyance over distance, and you definitely do not want to be caught in the crossfire of multiple lancers, either. Best for players who value accuracy and prefer fighting from a distance.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hammerburst:</span> medium-high power, medium to long range, not as accurate as the lancer, not very good in close quarters but has good stopping power. Forget about zooming in with the hammerburst, your bullet spread stays the same and you waste a precious second clicking in. There is NO headshot multiplier, unlike the other weapons--so don’t even bother aiming for the head. Best for players who want more power than what the lancer offers at mid/long range, but at the price of a smaller clip and recoil.

Now we get to the gnasher versus sawed off debate. This is a difficult call, as both weapons can lead to the same result in capable hands: at mid or close range, enemies will be gibbed or seriously hurt. They’re shotguns, after all. Both weapons won’t be entirely consistent in doing it, despite claims of the ease of use of the sawed off.

So, which is for you? It’s difficult for me to say. If you’re up for the idea of killing multiple people with a single shot, and don’t mind long reload times--which presupposes that you have survivability--then sawed off is for you. At the same time, most gnasher fights happen at close range, and most close range battles end in gibbing opponents...not to mention that the large clip size makes it, hypothetically speaking, possible to kill many opponents before having to reload.

I’ll leave it at “both weapons can be monstrous in capable hands.”

Here’s a detailed damage breakdown for each weapon, which is a must-watch.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBPcavSSsI

<strong>    9. Teamwork is crucial</strong>
It doesn’t matter what game type we’re talking about. You need to play as a team. Having buddies who you know is ideal, but not always possible. I cannot recommend the buddying system enough. Crossfire tears people apart, you are able to scout more efficiently, backup and a guaranteed revive buddy are amazing tools to have, and, it’s fantastic to bait an enemy while your buddy comes up behind them for the gib. You should not be playing this game lone wolf. Even if you know nobody on your team, try to stick together with somebody. I promise you will perform better for it.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/teamworkgearsofwar3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11914" title="teamworkgearsofwar3" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/teamworkgearsofwar3.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="288" /></a></p>
<strong>  8. Active, active, active</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Active reload can make a huge difference in a battle. Those times where you got downed by a single gnasher shot? That was active at work, and you want that kind of power, right?</p>
Some people prefer to not even bother with the first clip or couple of shots of a weapon, and start matches or lives by discarding a few and then getting active. That’s always an option, sure, but you need to actually learn how to do active first--the timing is different depending on the weapon. Active reload is something worth practicing for until you’ve got the muscle memory down, because you do NOT want to be in the middle of a battle, only to jam. And, with the cover system, you have ample opportunity to take a second or two in the middle of a fight to bolster your shot a little bit.

Active often. It can shave entire seconds off the time it takes to down someone.

<strong> 7. Spotting</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now here’s something I hardly ever see anyone do: spotting. Is it that people don’t know how to do it? Just aim at an enemy with your left trigger, then click in your left stick--boom, that enemy has been marked for a few seconds for your entire team. My personal philosophy is that if you can’t tell where at least half the enemy team is at any given moment, my team is failing. In any case, there’s no reason not to spot. Not only does it help the team know where everyone is, if that spot leads to a kill, then you receive 30 points. If you shot the guy a couple of times, you can get 50+ points despite not actually doing much. You like points, right?</p>
<strong>    6. Power weapon control</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Power weapons can turn the entire tide of a match, so it’s important to keep them under control.
Pressing your left button allows you to see where all power weapons are through objects, which is useful. Power weapons spawn way faster in 3 than they did in previous games, so there’s not much time for respite after someone has emptied their clip.</p>
Now, this does NOT mean you should scurry for a power weapon instantly just because it’s there. If you’re just dicking around with the weapon, you’re better off letting somebody else on your team, who has proven to be effective with it, have it. If you’re playing with a team, make sure to lay down who is best with what to establish a pecking order when it comes to power weapons.

If that’s not an option, well, better you, who may not know how to use the weapon (and can use this opportunity to learn it) than the enemy team, eh? Just remember that power weapons don’t go through teammates, so don’t be that idiot that shoots a boomshot, only to have it bounce off a teammate’s butt and explode in your face. They’ll be fine, you wont.
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly: don’t be that douche that stands on the edges of maps trying to be super cool by sniping. Most people suck with the sniper and will be lucky to land an errant headshot or two in an entire match, if that. Yeah, I said it: you suck with the sniper. Go do something useful for your team.</p>
<strong>   5. Right hand advantage</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now here’s something that isn’t just common sense and that even some veteran Gears players might not know: you have a right hand advantage. What the heck does that mean? Well, all characters hold the weapon on the right side. This means that you can stand behind cover--yes, not STICK to cover--while your weapon is outside of it. This means that you can shoot at enemies while being completely protected and still have mobility, which sticking to cover takes away. Here’s a video that shows it better than I can explain it.</p>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6ZuaIsRE30
<p style="text-align: left;">Always go for your right hand advantage.<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gearsofwarteam.jpg">
</a></p>
<strong> 4. Movement</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here, too, is a place where most players could use improvement. Gears of War is ALL about movement at it’s heart. Top Gears players do not move like you do. If you’ve seen one, you probably swore that they move in inhuman ways, in ways that the game should not allow. That’s probably astute, since high level movement is essentially bending/breaking the animations.</p>
For instance: roadie running is NOT the top speed possible. Sliding and vaulting from cover to cover is, but this requires not only the reflexes to cancel a slide (done by leaning the left stick opposite the direction of the cover you’re sticking to, right after or right before you actually stick to it) and stick to the next possible cover ahead of you (hence, think of cover around you as nodes connecting to one another). This can be used to perform the infamous wallbouncing, which is much more difficult to perform in Gears 3.

Here’s a video that covers wall bouncing in it, since this is definitely a visual thing.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XK27uc43Ek

So: roadie running is useful, but you really should be sliding and vaulting from cover to cover, when useful and possible.

Rolls are, in conjuction with wall bouncing, the end all be all of evasive maneuvers. Use them both to play mind games with your opponents. You should also know that you can roll in all 360 directions--don’t just roll in the cardinal directions!

Lastly, remember the mantle kick. You are not safe behind cover when an enemy is directly in front of you, and the mantle kick is Gears of War’s way of rewarding players who take the initiative. That player should be you. The mantle kick can stun multiple opponents, too, if they’re jumbled together. Lastly: you can totally stand just outside the mantle range (might take some practice) and gib enemies who think they’re about to mantle you.

<strong>    3. Map control</strong>
Again, Gears is no longer a one gun game. You can and will control entire maps by pairing power weapons with assault rifles and spotting. Pick up strategic locations on maps to fend off enemies, like the top of the hill on trenches, or be aware of typical enemy spawn points to nip the problem at it’s bud. All it takes is a few people in key locations--often vantage points--with their lancers out and ready to make sure that nobody on the opposite team can so much as breathe without being torn up.

This requires knowing your way around maps, though. Make sure to dip into a few private matches to take in the landscape, identify hiding spots and vantage points. Gears 3 has a lot more nooks and crannies than 2 did, it’s important to know where those are and what advantages they pose--especially now that there aren’t as many closed off areas. Any key areas are visible if not reachable from other key areas, too. It’s possible, for example, to torque someone at boomshot from the belltower in old town, if not grenade either of those points from the safety of grenade spawn. It’s possible to one shot into boomshot spawn in Mercy. The list goes on and on, but the gist of it is that maps are very versatile and open and it’s important to be aware of what you can do from point A, just as much as it’s important to know how open and vulnerable you are at point A from points B and C.

<strong>  2. WWYD?</strong>
High level play is all about mind games. That’s what is at the heart of wall bouncing, for instance--you have to be erratic and go where enemies don’t think you will go. But, more than this, it’s important top recognize what common player behaviors are and take advantage of them. Ask yourself, "what would I be doing right now?" This may make the difference between a grenade that kills one person, versus a grenade that nets you a quinn. It can mean being able to sneak up on an entire enemy team. Know what high traffic areas are. Know where people like to go or do--often, it’s as simple as knowing that people like to go after power weapons. It might also just mean knowing that the safest direction to roll in is at x degrees, to line up your shot there. This isn’t something I can teach or speak to inasmuch as you simply must get a feel for after playing for a while, especially since what people do differs from map to map.

<strong>  1. Learn from those better than you</strong>
You will undoubtedly come across somebody who makes you regret going online in the first place. Don’t let their skill get you down: use the opportunity to analyze how this person players and why their actions are so effective against you. Next time around, try to not repeat your mistakes, and try some of the tricks or techniques that person used--perhaps you’ll perform almost as well as they do!
<p style="text-align: left;">Bonus tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don't forget the smokes. One of these puppies can render an entire enemy team incapable of shooting for a few seconds. Don't be discouraged when you're outnumbered, smokes can change everything!</li>
	<li>Just the same: don't (always) be the hero. Sometimes it's best to just plain run away if it means surviving or reuniting with your teammates.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's not a game. It's a "psycho-social audiovisual experiment". Yeah... anyways...

<strong>SUPERBROTHERS: SWORD &amp; SWORCERY EP</strong> is a videogame developed and published by <strong>Superbrothers</strong> and <strong>Capybara Games</strong> for the iPhone and the iPad. The<strong> iPad</strong> version was played for the purpose of this review. It was directed by <strong>CRAIG D. ADAMS</strong> and <strong>JIM GUTHRIE</strong>.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Icon.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11925" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Icon.png" alt="" width="176" height="177" /></a></p>
You know a game is worth playing when it leaves reviewers so puzzled they have no other choice other to describe the game by using quotes from other people – the game’s creators included.

<em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</em> (S:S&amp;S EP) is one of these games. It has whimsical pixelated graphics. It has some brilliant soundtrack by Jim Guthrie, which vindicates the “EP” from the game’s name. And the thin fabric uniting this artistic collaboration is a vague quest. It’s just like a videoclip, perhaps a poem. Probably both.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-29-09-11-07-01-56.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11950" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-29-09-11-07-01-56.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
You play as The Scythian. This hints the game might take place somewhere near East/Central Asia. The Scythian has a sword and a shield and is looking for some holy triangles for unexplained motives. It is a quest for martyrdom and while we don’t know exactly the whys, we know that martyrdom is certainly desired. During this martyrdom quest, The Scythian will occasionally battle dark entities and wolves by timing offence and defense inputs or solve “puzzles” by tapping the screen until something happens. I use quotation marks because these are more like Doing Stuff Instead of Walking moments rather than actual puzzles. You know, like opening doors and pressing switches on FPSes.

In other words, we are dealing with the Zelda archetype here. S:S&amp;S EP knows this of course. There is even a character called The Archetype who plays the role of the game creators and explains some of the few meanings the game has to offer.

This is why reviewers have so much trouble with S:S&amp;S EP. Archetypes are exactly what are left after you’ve stripped a work of all its meanings. The little content that remained was written for Twitter. Everything in S: S&amp;S EP was written to be quoted. They are fancy and dandy so you can tweet them and your friends will think you are also a whimsical and woeful individual. It comes with the territory, however, that these quotes are highly cryptic in order to mask themselves as profound.

So you see? It all hints to a higher meaning… and we all expect a higher meaning... – which isn’t there. Thus some people try to fill that void with their own interpretation and that's how a highly quotable game can produce a web of reviews quoting one another.

Still, those are all false assumptions. The same ones people have when addressing an unfamiliar poem. They either think there is something wrong with S: S&amp;S EP; or that the game is a code to be cracked; or that S:S&amp;S EP means whatever they want it to mean. But Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is none of that. It’s just a little game trying to evoke some moods with their songs and artwork.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-29-09-11-06-59-13.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11952" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Photo-29-09-11-06-59-13.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
There are, however, two instances when the Nice Little Game shows us it could one day be a Game About Something.

Not that it ever is, mind you. S:S&amp;S EP merely flirts with the idea. The first one happens inside a giant tree where a boor is dancing. You can engage him in battle if you like and, after beating him, as the boor is agonizing, you choose whether or not you will finish the job. The in-game consequence is the same whatever your choice: a key to an optional room. But afterwards, when you read what The Archetype had to say about the boor's fate, you'll find this (which I immediately broadcasted through Twitter, by the way):

The Grizzled Boor was included in S:S&amp;S EP to allow participants to self-identify as compassionate, reasonable people.

Suddenly the consequence for killing the Grizzled Boor is much deeper. Sure, I could be feeling bad already for turning a creature that was just minding his own business into a puddle of meat and blood, but it’s one thing to feel something and quite another to become aware of that feeling as a mirror reflecting your actions is presented. It’s a moment of reflection not present in the majority of games, which, more often than not, transforms actions that might mark any sensible human, like killing other survivors in the world of <em>Fallout 3</em> (Tranquility Lane quest, I’m talking to you!), into trivial routines. But then again, such games don’t feature characters or even believable living beings; they are populated by quest-givers, obstacles and goals instead.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Boorfight.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11951" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Boorfight.png" alt="" width="260" height="348" /></a>

The second one comes up near the end of the game, when The Archetype states that all that remains is for you to do is to forcefully drag The Scythian in concluding her quest.

Wait a second, I thought, what does he mean with “forcefully”? Does it mean that The Scythian doesn’t want to conclude her quest? Is there a disconnection between the gamer’s motivation (to advance in the game) and the protagonist’s motivation? That this point wasn’t actually elaborated at any point in the game is quite frustrating.

The game doesn’t really care about that, though. Music and pixels are its things and it is so confident of their hypnotic appeal and authenticity that S:S&amp;S EP could very well be called Hipster Zelda. To experience S:S&amp;S EP is to experience aesthetics built upon pastiche, references and ironies. The problem with the hipster culture is when that kind of aesthetic has exhausted itself. This isn’t the case here. S:S&amp;S EP may not blow your mind and it certainly isn't the greatness lauded on the net, but it’s still the most hypnotic and authentic experience you can find on the iPad. Just a nice little game. A <span style="color: #000080"><strong>good game</strong></span>.

The moon is high over the Nibenay Basin in the province of Cyrodiil.  I am being chased from a cave by an angry Minotaur because I stole an enchanted claymore.  I am Raffen Valnyd, a Wood Elf archer with a penchant for adventure and a generally sunny disposition.  I get on well with the town guard, and many of the chapel healers admire my dedication to upholding the law.  Yet apart from the fact that I have spent the most recent part of my life in prison, the details of my life are completely blank.  My Imperial gaolers did not provide me with so much as a name or a race and, upon breaking out of my cell I have spent my time establishing everything about myself, from my proficiencies to my personal inclinations to my food preferences.  I am, quite literally, a self-made man.

This sort of open-ended character minimalism is the hallmark of the above Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and a handful of other open world titles similar to it, yet for as much praise as this type of gameplay generally receives, we don’t see very much of it.  From Halo to Metal Gear Solid to freaking Mario, the majority of games today strive for presenting a tightly focused narrative, centering around an iconic blockbuster character.  The ultimate goal seems to be to create a cinematic experience that rivals something found in Hollywood; in fact, the term “cinematic” has become an almost universal exclamation of praise to be bestowed upon a game.

Except games aren’t cinema.  I’ve said it before, and I repeat myself emphatically now - video games and films are two totally different mediums, and the former should absolutely not strive to be the latter.  Unfortunately, when you create a game spotlighting a prominent, highly featured central character, the experience as a whole tends to gravitate, even subconsciously towards this false holy grail of the “cinematic game experience.”

The problem is this - these characters have voice (literally, in most cases).  They have history and motivations.  They’ve been <em>established</em>.  These are all filmic conventions for creating a narrative.  But here’s where the big difference between games and film gets dragged painfully to the surface.  Films are, narratively speaking, a static medium.  You watch the story played out by the characters, and you are completely beholden to it.  Video games, on the other hand, are almost the very embodiment of “dynamic medium”, and to try and force static narrative conventions like firm characterizations on to a dynamic medium can create serious problems.

Consider, if you will, Grand Theft Auto IV.  In Rockstar’s latest magnum opus, you play as Niko Bellic, a Balkan immigrant with a sordid past.  Though he is motivated by his guilt, his straight-laced yet eternally unlucky cousin, and a blossoming romance with the innocent sister of one of his new compatriots to break free of his history of violence and ultimately change his ways, he inevitably finds himself ever dragged back down into the underbelly of Liberty City.  This internally-motivated conflict forms the narrative backbone of GTAIV, as we are told through beautifully rendered, very cinematic cutscenes and in-game dialogue between Niko and the game’s other characters.

Here’s the rub - Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that predicates itself on absolute player freedom and open exploration in a living city.  To try and force a fixed narrative into a game like that seems at best, silly and at worst damaging to the game’s credibility.  We are told through cutscenes that Niko desires a break from his violent past, yet I have distinct memories of mowing down businessmen in a stolen Lamborghini (sorry, Infernus) dropping hand grenades out my driver-side window to evade the police.  I dated several girls from the Internet (and even railed a few) in spite of the seemingly serious relationship being developed with Kate McReary.  In other words, I could do things that were directly contradictory to the characterization of Niko I was given through the game’s static narrative, and it had absolutely no bearing on how the game played out.  It was as though Rockstar’s Niko and my Niko were two totally different characters who just happened to inhabit the same game world.  The tension (or, to get terminological on you, “ludonarrative dissonance”) that this caused got so bad that as a result, the game’s deep and (let’s face it) heavy handed narrative started to diminish in impact.  The cutscenes were, after all, just distractions I had to endure in between my rampages of violence and debauchery.

Obviously few would realistically argue that the way to avoid this problem would be to remove some of that choice from games and force you with a stronger hand to walk the path outlined by the story.  That would strip games of their defining elements, and we’d simply be playing through somebody’s long-winded, 12 hour movie - no thank you!  Instead, let’s finally recognize the differences that games have with film.  Films use characters and established narratives to communicate their thematic messages because those are the only tools available to them.  In a video game, I don’t need that because I inhabit the world myself.  I literally create my own story.  To cling to these vestigial elements only holds games back from their true narrative potential and as a result we get a massive confusion of story and gameplay.  Let’s finally take the step and cut the character, or at least the “narrative” character out of the equation altogether.

It’s encouraging to see that some developers are already experimenting with this.  I recently bought Ubisoft’s Far Cry 2 on a whim, and upon playing through it was impressed at how character-agnostic the game was.  Before the game even begins, you choose a character to play as from a list.  No characterization is offered; you have nothing but a name and a nationality to distinguish your chosen avatar from any of the others.  The game itself features no overarching narrative that guides the action.  That’s not to say that the game is listless and nebulous, as you are playing through a story of sorts.  But Ubisoft is stingy with the details and that is, ultimately, the game’s greatest strength.  You know the basics (setting, overall “point” of the game, etc).  The rest is up to you.  There are no cutscenes to try and tell you what “should” be happening.  The action is never broken up (or worse, contradicted) by distinct “story” segments, for there’s hardly any to speak of.  The story in Far Cry 2 is simply the story of your chosen mercenary, as told by you, the player, through the action that you choose to take part in.  You create it as you play.

The truth is that video games are an excellent storytelling medium.  Their narrative potential surpasses, I think, even that of film.  Which is why it kills me that people seem to be obsessed with making games mimic movies as much as possible.  To try and recreate the cinematic in a video game seems, if anything, to be limiting to the medium.  Grand Theft Auto IV is, almost objectively speaking, a fantastic game and a genuine achievement for video games as a whole.  Yet as I was playing it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was playing somebody else’s story with somebody else’s character, with me just being the vessel.  In video games, we are no longer simply the audience.  We are now also the author of our own story, as told by how we play.  These blockbuster characters, as well established and expertly characterized as they are, are a barrier to video games actualizing on their narrative potential.  We must move past cinematic mimesis and kill the character in order for games to truly come to life.

		<title>Bullet Time in Brazil: Rockstar on Max Payne 3</title>

<em>Max Payne</em> is a series predicated on aesthetic. It may have popularized bullet-time and third-person shooting, but its real strength is its use of film-noir tropes - its deeply flawed protagonist, revenge plot, perennially stormy nights, comic-book panel exposition and bitter narration were so good ready-built for a Hollywood adaptation, but even $35 million couldn't get the game's story right on celluloid. Now Rockstar have taken over the series from Remedy Entertainment, and despite their fondness of genre film, are stripping away those familiar conventions, throwing Max into the underworld of Brazil.

"This is a new chapter in Max's life, told several years later," said art director Rob Nelson in an interview with IGN. "And we want the story to move on significantly from the previous games while continuing the original storyline in a natural and logical way."

"It's been a few years, but Max still carries the same emotional baggage from the events of the earlier games - a mixture of anger, regret and guilt - that he's been keeping at bay with alcohol and painkillers."

The comic panel cutscenes will make a return, but this time in a more dynamic, animated form.

"Instead of a static panel or page, we're creating an almost motion-comic feel that blends in-game footage, text and Max's iconic monologue, which are over laid on the game to produce something that is pretty amazing and really helps give the game a digital noir feel."

Bullet time isn't going anywhere either; using Rockstar's in-house RAGE engine, the Vancouver studio has refined the mechanic to a fine art.

"Bullets are individually modeled, and hits register dynamically and individually on every enemy. Every gun is modeled as accurately as possible, with the hammer and slide cocking back after each shot.

"Our goal is to set a new benchmark for sophistication and feel in a 3rd-person shooter – we've really tried to make the experience as intense and focused as possible."

<em>Max Payne 3</em> is due for a tri-platform release in March 2012.

Fresh from last week's preview tournament in France, GnouzCorp has uploaded glorious hi-def gameplay footage for all the world to see. There's not much new in the way of information, but it does give us a wonderful look both at how the game will actually play and the multitude of new mechanics at work.

Fans of <em>Lost in Shadow</em> have an impressive-looking little platformer to look forward to this October called <em>Sideway: New York</em><em>.</em> The game is about a graffiti artist named Nox who messed with the wrong tag and has been transported to the very canvas of his work and has become graffiti himself. Scott Simpson of developer Playbrains discussed with Playstation Blog some of the finer details of the game. Throughout the main game the player will be able to unlock new abilities that range from the classic double jump to the risk-reward juggle called airtime that allows you to can briefly leave the wall, but be blown away in the wind unless you return within a short amount of time. An animated series is being produced along with the game and will be providing the art assets, which is probably the best delegation a traditionally animated game can get. <em>Sideway</em> will also feature drop in/out co-op mode.

"It is fun to play with a friend. You’ll be on the same screen at the same time. It gives you a different way to solve puzzles. It’s not intended to be a “girlfriend mode” where you’re just tagging along (see what I did there?), but you’re actually both advancing the story equally. If you play as the second player you’ll play “Fume”, your Yoda-like sidekick who’s actually guiding you through the world here, " explains Simpson.

For those of you whose October gaming budget is likely to be mostly transfered to November to cover <em>Uncharted 3, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, </em>and <em>Skyrim, </em>a $9.99 game like this should be a fun and economic way to have a new game to play this month. <em>Sideway: New York</em> releases October 11.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_11988" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="This looks delicious, but if someone tells me this is a lie and expects me to laugh I will bludgeon them with the cake pan."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ggnewspost2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11988" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ggnewspost2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="260" /></a>[/caption]

Both of these blogs are likely to be contenders in your top "how the hell did I not know this existed!" list. If you've ever wondered what a ration from <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>tastes like, <a href="http://www.gourmetgaming.co.uk/">Gourmet Gaming</a> has recipes inspired by the iconic edibles of the gaming world including the cake from <em>Portal</em> and the "meat" from <em>Golden Axe. </em>Some of the recipes seem a little phoned in like golden brown pizza from <em>Dead Rising</em>, which is literally just a pizza. That said, it does look like an amazing recipe for a pizza. Either way, if you fancy yourself a cook and love gaming, be sure to check the blog for updates every Wednesday.

If you're more interested in getting your drink on, <a href="http://www.thedrunkenmoogle.com/">The Drunken Moogle</a> is the next tab you should be opening in your browser. The site serves as your go to source for gaming-themed drinking games, cocktails, and all manner of alcohol related merchandise like shot glasses and mugs. The real standouts for me are the <em>Pokemon </em>cocktails that evolve from shots to full on drinks. Here's the recipe for the Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard shotsn (copied from the site):

<em>Charmander-
1 splash of grenadine
1 oz Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey
.5 oz Bacardi 151</em>

<em>Charmeleon-
1 spash of grenadine,
1 splash of scotch
1 oz Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey
Fill with ginger ale</em>

<em>Charizard-
2 oz Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey
2 splashes of grenadine
2 splash of scotch
1.5 ounces Bacardi 151
Fill with ginger ale </em>

<strong></strong><em>For the Charmander shot, pour a slash of grenadine into the bottom of a shot glass. Add the Fireball, then top with the Bacardi 151. Light it on fire, then extinguish before drinking.  </em>
<em>For the Charmeleon cocktail, mix all the alcoholic ingredients and then pour over ice in a lowball glass. Top with ginger ale.   </em>
<em>For the Charizard drink, Mix all of the alcoholic ingredients, pour into a highball glass and top with ginger ale.  If you plan on lighting the Charizard on fire, add the Bacardi 151 last, after the ginger ale, on top of everything else.  As always, be careful with flames and don’t try to drink flaming cocktails while still on fire! Fire burns people and stuff and faces.</em>

Fire does indeed burn people, stuff, and faces. I know I'm going to be giving these a try. Websites like this are the best kind of examples of gaming culture growing up.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<ul>Could you give us a brief introduction to what Dead State is, and what goals you've set for it? It seems like most new games must include zombies in some</ul>
<ul>form. What seperates yours from the others?</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>Dead State is a survival-based RPG that also just happens to have zombies. The zombie apocalypse setting makes the survival aspect more accessible and plays up the horror angle a bit more, while enforcing mechanics like noise (which attracts the attention of the undead) and panic (which affects your allies’ ability to handle combat situations). Unlike a lot of zombie games, we’re not throwing in zombies because they’re popular, but because we want to make a game that accurately represents what people like about the zombie genre – the long-term survival aspect. While we have combat, we’re less about run-and-gun and more about avoiding the undead, managing stress in companions, and trying to build up a shelter for a prolonged defense against threats from zombies and other human survivors.</ul>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="font-size: 43.875px;line-height: 64.125px">Allow me to make your Monday more pleasant with footage of Bethesda's E3 2011 demo of Skyrim that is now available to us mere mortals of the general public! These three videos showcase Skyrim's combat, intutitive menus, vastly improved animations, dual-wielding spells and swords, and <em>fucking dragons attacking giants who were previously herding mastodons!</em></p>

"In X-Men Destiny, players control the fate of one of three brand-new mutant characters forced to choose between saving humanity or ensuring its destruction. The branching storyline, penned by acclaimed Marvel writer Mike Carey, features a deep element of choice, allowing players to customize the path, powers and development of their character and to decide their role in the mutant cause alongside, or against, some of Marvel’s greatest X-Men franchise characters, such as Magneto, Cyclops, Wolverine and Gambit."]]></content:encoded>

Adding on to the pile of Australian game studio closures, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/IGDAMelbourne/status/115583184829296640">it has been confirmed</a> that Visceral Studios Melbourne has closed it's doors. The studio was reportedly working on a AAA title for the past three years, but the new Vice President for EA's Game Label evidently didn't like what he saw.

With <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/thq-realigns-business-200-jobs-cut-from-studio-closures-208380.phtml">THQ closing two studios</a>, the <a href="http://au.gamespot.com/news/6332196/team-bondi-goes-into-administration">end of Team Bondi</a>, and now Visceral all shutting down in the span of a few short months, this is not the best time to be a game developer in Australia. With all this happening in such a short span of time, I wonder how much more the Australian video game industry can take.

		<title>Deus Ex Human Revolution&#039;s Boss Fights Were Outsourced</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_10999" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="I really can&#039;t remember the names of these two. And chances are, neither can you!"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/deux-ex-bosses.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10999 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/deux-ex-bosses.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a>[/caption]

Well, that explains why the boss fights felt so different from the rest of the game.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game that lets you play however you want, and it does this pretty admirably. The boss fights, however, force you into fighting, no matter what your style-of-play is. This has resulted in criticism: the boss battles force you into one playstyle, and they tend to feel out of place, too.

Criticism was also given to the bosses for being so under-characterized; hell, I can't even remember the names of two thirds of the bosses. The bosses are rarely referred to, and we are given nothing about who they are, why they're doing what they're doing, or anything about them, really. In a game where you can investigate and learn about damn near everyone, this choice can be considered  "odd". Now we know why.

The studio behind the boss fights is G.R.I.P.. Here's a video of the CEO talking about the boss fights:
<p style="text-align: center"></p>
Interesting note: he says he's a "shooter guy", and didn't know that much about Deus Ex in general. This might explain why there was no solution other that "shooting" for the bosses.

The video implies that they had a hand in the social battles as well, which were actually really good. This would explain why the facial animations for these sections are so well done.

Luck decides who walks away, and who gets to end his miserable existence with a bayonet in his gullet. You curse this place, and whatever officer put you on this mission. What’s the point anyway? What use are we in this hellhole? You hear the distant sound of footsteps. The cracking of branches. The sloshing sound of boots wading through a bog. Now’s your chance. Stay quiet, and keep a straight shot.</pre>]]></content:encoded>

The latest trailer for <em>Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em> features a love note, eyelash fluttering, and plenty of longing glances. It's nice to see that this time around we might actually get to see a convincing romance blossom between Link and Zelda. It's a promising concept that's never been fully realised in the series and I for one am happy to welcome it. Characterization has never been a strong suit for the series in spite of the amazingly expressive faces of the characters in <em>Wind Waker </em>and <em>Twilight Princess</em>. With the sheer amount of feeling you can get out of just watching this little trailer, you can tell Nintendo is aiming to give us more than pretty faces this time around. Although my personal opinion of the series has not been positive lately, this video put a smile on my face.

Fresh off the press, Square has finally revealed the first pieces of post-launch DLC intended for <em>Final Fantasy XIII-2</em>, starting with Omega. Known more commonly as Omega Weapon, fans of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series should have no problems recognizing this iconic enemy.

Not only one of the strongest bosses throughout the series, he was also the franchise's first superboss (along with Shinryu), kicking off the now longstanding tradition of including of super-difficult optional bosses that make the even the final encounter seem like a walk through the park. As with other monsters in <em>FFXIII-2</em>, upon defeat, you'll be able to recruit him into your party, giving you the possibility of an incredibly strong ally.

Sup?"]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/10/final-fantasy-xiii-2-to-have-dlc-enemies-starting-with-omega-weapon-11995/final_fantasy_v_advance_-_omega_weapon/" rel="attachment wp-att-11997"><img class="size-full wp-image-11997" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Final_Fantasy_V_Advance_-_Omega_Weapon.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="234" /></a>[/caption]

In addition to Omega, the game's post-launch DLC will also include optional costumes for both Serah and Noel. No word yet on the expected release date for this content, and as of right now, it's only been announced for the Japanese market--much like the Calamity Blade and Seraphic Wing pre-order DLC weapons. Hopefully Square Enix will have something to announce to the western market in the near future.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> And just like that, Square Enix has announced that Japan's post-launch DLC will be America's preorder DLC. Preordering at GameStop will score you the bonus costumes for Serah and Noel, while preordering at Amazon will net you the battle with Omega. No word yet on whether or not Japan's preorder bonuses, the Calamity Blade and Seraphic Wing, will make their way overseas.]]></content:encoded>

</a>

In his review of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Rock Paper Shotgun’s John Walker recognized that the game’s controversial boss fights were not just a nuisance, but a mystery. “Feeling as though they were programmed by another team, from another planet, they absolutely, unequivocally do not fit in this game. They’re the sort of inclusion that you can only think, ‘I can’t wait until enough time has passed that the developers will feel able to tell the miserable story of why this happened.’

The story seemed to be revealing itself when we learned that that the boss battles <em>were</em> <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/09/18/eidos-montreal-outsourced-deus-ex-39-s-boss-battles.aspx">designed by another team</a>. "Aha!" we could say. "It wasn't Eidos Montreal's fault at all! They really are as brilliant as the rest of the game would suggest!"

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's not that simple. In an interview with G4, game director Jean-Francoise Dugas confirms that while the boss fights were outsourced to one G.R.I.P Entertainment, they were designed to Eidos Montreal's specifications.

<!--more-->

"Grip did an excellent job with us for the mandate they had, they did exactly what we asked for, and so the only people responsible for the boss fights are us internally," explained Dugas. "The thing is we couldn't make them with the vision we had first, and when we realized that, we were so far along in the development process that cutting them totally would have created other problems elsewhere in the storyline which would have created more damage to the experience. We decided to support them, even though they were more combat oriented - the goal was that at least they will be somewhat entertaining, and we won't make them frustrating."

So there you have it. Eidos Montreal was wholly aware that the boss fights were not consistent with the rest of game's design or its vision. He noted that in the original design, boss fights "were meant to be like the rest of the game, where you have different choices - you can be stealthy, you can be lethal or non-lethal, you can be combat oriented." Yet as so often happens, the team underestimated the time it would take to implement their design plan, and nuanced boss fights - along with extra city-hubs, weapons, and augmentations - were what got cut. Why exactly this decision was made so late in the design process, or why they weren't able to complete it despite a four-year development cycle, remains to be seen.

Crytek  has expressed the desire to produce quality free-to-play games. CEO Cevat Yerli discussed this new direction for the company in a recent interview with Now Gamer.

<em>"...what I think we’re really trying to do now – as an initiative going forward – is to try and increase the quality of the free-to-play market."</em>

This is a huge deal coming from a company that pumped out a game whose graphical prowess trumped most PCs at the time of its release. More importantly, it was a great game. Anyone who has delved into the free-to-play market in its current state knows that quality is a bit of a mixed bag mostly dominated by sub-par MMORPGs. Although the amount of free games out there can only be considered a positive thing, I'm sure we'd all like to see a few more games like <em>Vindictus</em> and <em>Team Fortress 2</em> along with less games like <em>Elf Online</em><em></em>.<em></em>

Yerli also discussed Crytek's reaction to the success of cloud gaming services like Onlive and Gaikai. We won't be seeing any Crytek games on those services any time soon, as he clarifies that putting free-to-play games on a such services would be "prohibitively expensive." This is reasonable considering the costs of running servers that can <em>stream</em> games. However, Yerli did state that this decision could be reconsidered if some sort of free-to-play system were introduced to cloud gaming.

<em>"But if cloud gaming changes to support the free-to-play model, then I think that is going to be very interesting for gamers around the world. So for those companies who are trying to replace the retail models, they are doing the first steps on this, to pave the way for next-generation cloud gaming and I think that should be applauded."</em>

I'll drink to that, good sir. So, readers, what other developers/publishers would you like to see tackle the free-to-play market?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dragon-Age-2-warrior_shield-o.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12040 aligncenter" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dragon-Age-2-warrior_shield-o-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="322" /></a>

Speaking to <a href="//www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-03-bioware-ea-doesnt-tell-us-what-to-do”">Eurogamer</a>, Bioware heads Ray Mazuka and Greg Zeschuk state that Bioware is largely independent in what it does, and that EA isn’t forcing them to do anything.

<em>"One thing we commonly see is when fans don't like something we do, they put in the comments, 'Oh those EA guys, they're making BioWare do...' And I always chuckle because we are EA, we're BioWare - we're both, and we still have huge autonomy in terms of what we do,"</em> said Zeschuk.

<em>"We're not being forced to do anything or told to do anything. We make the decisions. We take input.”</em>

These days, Mazuka and Zeschuk aren’t part of the rank-and-file development process. Mazuka bosses the RPG/MMO label at EA, and Zeschuk is overseeing <em>The Old Republic</em>. They also participate in EA's green-light process, which means they most likely have a bit of say in what gets/doesn't get made. This means they typically delegate other duties to their experienced team leaders: Mike Laidlaw for Dragon Age and Casey Hudson for Mass Effect.

So remember, if Bioware does rather questionable, like, hypothetically speaking, turning an old-style RPG into a more “action-y” and “mainstream” title, and ret-conning quite a bit of lore and rendering some of your choices from a previous game void, and getting rid of mod support, then it's all Bioware.

Again, this is just hypothetical. I'm sure it won't happen. If it does, remember to complain at, or praise, the right people.

Well, it didn't work. Could've at least used a picture that didn't say DA2 on it. Though I doubt anyone wouldn't recognize it who actually reads this. But really, would any company ever admit (while employed) that the overhead is deciding the course of the game?
Though I don't actually believe that EA messes with companies like Bioware. They want to entice more companies to come under their label so they give them independence and flash images of Darth Sidious whose face has been replaced by an Ubisoft logo every 60th screen refresh.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(*Heavy spoilers for Heavenly Sword*)

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/09/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-wests-thematic-failure-11212/">Last week</a> I lambasted Ninja Theory's second major game, Enslaved, for being an unconnected, thematically stupid, waste of potential. What made this failure hit harder than most abysmal failures in the AAA game space was their previous game, Heavenly Sword. Whereas Enslaved was a thematic mess that couldn't follow through on any of its set up (a post-apocalyptic, savage land, philosophical journey, relationship metaphor) and ended up with a muddled pile of unfulfilled promises and pointless distraction, Heavenly Sword is a streamlined, compact piece of work with all the pieces (a revenge and redemption story set in the mythical iron age in the style of a wuxia movie) going in the same direction. Ludonarrative dissonance (Though Enslaved was more of a case of ludonarrative-who-gives-a-shit.) is a term that gets thrown around a lot - most of the time misapplied - to the consternation of many, but its opposite, ludonarrative resonance, is an apt term for Heavenly Sword. It is a combat heavy game where its elements not only work well with the combat they demand it.

Heavenly Sword, at its core, is a game thematically about revenge and secondarily redemption. Both of these themes comes across during the narrative elements, but reinforced by the mechanical and aesthetic ones. All the elements of the game support an excellent story within the interactive experience. The game chose an aesthetic quality and worked with it to create a cohesive whole.

The theme of revenge is front and center in the game. We begin in medias res with the player as Nariko thrust into a battle against a vast army before succumbing to the titular sword draining her life away. From there we enter a frame narrative within the consciousness of the sword itself sending us back 5 days to see how we got to that point. We learn Nariko was a child of prophecy, but the prophecy called for a male savior to wield the Heavenly Sword and Nariko was deemed cursed because she didn't fit the description and her mother died in childbirth meaning there wouldn't be a second child. Her father is distant at best and she is held in contempt by the rest of her clan. Into this oh so stable situation comes King Bohan, a ruthless conqueror who wants the sword to his own ends. He does this by slaughtering and/or kidnapping everyone in an attempt for Nariko to give up the weapon. So she, along with her sidekick/friend/surrogate sister Kai go on a rescue/revenge mission against Bohan.

It is standard martial arts story arc with a few interesting twists. A martial artist looked down upon, rejected or otherwise disrespected goes on a journey to grow in skill and as a person. This is emphasized by the mechanics of game. We progress from sub-chapter to sub-chapter, entering new locals always moving forward for we are on a mission. The more Nariko fights the more combos in the various stances are earned, representing her growing in skill. Nariko is very ruthless person in how she dispatches her enemies before moving on to the next batch. They plead and back off not wanting to confront her, but the violent nature of the era and circumstances mean they are going to die regardless. She charges up to them and slaughters them by the dozen. They are the faceless fodder for the martial artist to overcome so that one may face the real challenges, the masters.

Revenge is a dirty business and a violent one at that. The game is filled to the brim with elements subtly and overtly reinforcing the conflict between Nariko and Bohan and their animosity towards one another. And this is not just a matter of war and survival; there is real animosity between Nariko and Bohan's forces. She taunts both Whiptail and Roach to get under their skin, to psychologically harm them as much as physically harm them. She is outright cruel with her words and unnecessarily vicious towards them. This is not a war. This is hate. The violence of the combat is only one such element to emphasize it.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/10/heavenly-swords-thematic-resonacne-12048/heavenly-sword-02/" rel="attachment wp-att-12049"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12049" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Heavenly-Sword-02.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="346" /></a>
Heavenly Sword is an example of the wuxia genre. Ninja Theory based the game's style on the filmic style of the genre, the most well known examples of which are Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers. These are all martial arts films with emphasis on fast, physics defying combat and acrobatics. The wuxia genre has its beginning in Chinese literature with the genre adapting into every medium since, but Heavenly Sword takes its stylistic cues from the movies. It build on the stylized fighting and generic archtypes of Asian cinema, as seen through the eyes of westerners, and utilizes those traits to its own end. The combat is fast and smooth, with one of the three fighting stances emphasizing the near impossible acrobatics (range stance) which are also represented at certain sequences through quick time events and makes some interesting choices with regards to secondary mechanics all grounding the mechanics as well as the narrative in the wuxia genre.

At the time of the game's release Heavenly Sword was relentlessly compared to God of War because of it's combat. It is important to note the differences between Heavenly Sword's and God of War's. God of War's combat is far more brutal, emphasizing power and dominance through strength, while Heavenly Sword's combat is based on speed and dominance through martial skill. Kratos' movements feel heavy with weight behind them. He is heaving the Blades of Chaos with all his might to do as much damage as possible. The finish moves are brutal and gory to show his utter dominance over his foes. Nariko's fighting by contrast emphasizes martial skill and a sense of timing in the button presses. Through most of the game, tells given by the enemy animations and the timing of Nariko's own animations are the key to fighting. The style of combat represents her victory through ability rather than winning through a brute force mentality. This prowess of martial arts is taken to the ultimate extreme in the final chapter, where merely walking by one of the lesser enemies is more than enough to defeat them and single swing can send groups of them flying. Her ability has transcended mere mortals, even by the standards of game.

There are more than a few quick time events that display animations of gravity defying skill showing off maneuvers both in combat and out of it. When you build enough skill to fill the superstyle disc in the middle of your health meter you can execute a superstyle attack. These are special attacks that are an instant kill on the enemy you use it on and as you level them up by earning glyphs throughout the game they become more powerful and able to cause damage to surrounding enemies as well or finish off whole groups. The animations to the attack depend on which fighting stance you are in when you execute it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8a3_ll4DiM">Were these moves stung together it could have been right out of a wuxia movie</a>.

But what I think emphasizes the style most of all is the throwing/shooting mechanic. If one holds the button after unleashing a projectile the camera will follow its path and the player can control it through use of the PS3's sixaxis. You can make arrows bend around objects, weave through enemies, or just adjust course however many times needed to strike the target. Time slows down, both friends and foes alike reduced to a crawl only to resume normal speed once you let go. In no other genre can I think of any examples where the shooter has control over his ammo through some mystical martial skill that is never ever explained. The control is meant to represent firing in such a special way causing it to change direction or the shooter being skilled enough to have the projectile ride air currents to the target. Many games ape filmic styles to give the player an opportunity to feel like they are in a movie of their choice. Here Ninja Theory chose a genre that fits the game mechanics and where the constant combat does not feel extraneous.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/10/heavenly-swords-thematic-resonacne-12048/heavenly-sword-03/" rel="attachment wp-att-12050"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12050" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Heavenly-Sword-03.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="475" /></a>
As I mentioned before the setting and chosen genre also fit into the mold of revenge. Even the color palate gets in one it, with the game full of golds, oranges and reds. Nariko herself has golden skin with a long rope of bright red hair. These are the colors of violence and blood. Even the non-red colors are sent through a rust hued filter to give the game a rather unique look and one that visually sends signals to the player of what the game is about. Look at screenshots showing these factors alone and you know what the game is all about.

Bohan's raven, the bird of death, is another minor detail that reinforces the theme. It appears throughout the game along Nariko's path and eventually grants her enemy the power of a god to become "the Raven King." A king trying to kill her, the same one she openly declared to kill now represented by the bird of death. The reinforcement couldn't be more obvious.

Kai is an interesting character when it comes to the theme of revenge. She is an emphasis of violence meant to contrast with Nariko. Where Nariko is an up close fighter with all her skill tailored to the sword, Kai, on the other hand, is a long-range killer whose skills emphasize hiding, evading and shooting. But there is an innocence about her. She is meant to be much younger than Nariko, possibly in her early teens, but unlike Nariko there is no weight to death or killing. It is a game to her, to the extent at one point to get a password from a guard she threatens him by shooting his "weak spot" for "massive damage" before he gives in. Her entire personality is playful and lighthearted. Cracks begin to appear, however, when she finds Nariko in prison. She "doesn't want to play anymore" and "wants to go home" but it is no longer a game and she is starting to realize this. Then Kai comes face to face with General Flying Fox, one of King Bohan's minions, only to have the memories of the day she was orphaned come rushing back to her and his face taunting her. Suddenly Kai's behavior does a complete 180. Gone is carefree, strong-willed and, for lack of a better word, composed individual. Instead, we have a terrified screaming little girl trying to run away from her personal boogieman. She gets kidnapped and hung from Flying Fox's boss arena. Here her innocence dies. It's not Nariko who finishes off Flying Fox, but an awakened Kai with a single crossbow bolt to the head. She has gotten her revenge and lost a piece of herself in the process. Kai in a damaged person from the beginning as shown not just by her mannerisms, but attitude towards serious matters like running away from an army to which she prances along and runs in child like circles. Her revenge shocks her out of her oddness, but to what end. The childlike part of her has gone and knows only sorrow and upon awakening she is met by the final shock of Nariko's fate.

<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/2011/10/heavenly-swords-thematic-resonacne-12048/heavenly-sword-04/" rel="attachment wp-att-12055"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12055" src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Heavenly-Sword-04.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="306" /></a>

While most of the game focuses on the journey towards and power of revenge, beginning with Kai's revenge the game switches focus to the after effects. This is the end of the second act and shifts the thematic focus of revenge from the act to the personal effects. And out of revenge comes the possibility for redemption.

At the end of the first chapter Nariko is cornered and without any other choice she draws the heavenly sword and brings it to bear against Bohan's forces. The sword eventually drains the life force out of the wielder. In an effort to save her father and fulfill her charge she becomes a dead woman walking all for the sake of killing Bohan. She does die in the end, but even more telling is that a part of her is lost even before the final confrontation. From her first use of the weapon she loses a piece of herself. A part of her soul is sucked into the sword to become a prisoner within. When the sword is taken from her in the third chapter she comments that she feels empty without it. We see this part of her being in the in-between chapter cutscene and at the chapter selection screen. Even after her body dies a part of her will forever live in sword reliving these same 5 days for eternity as we the player can go back and replay any section of the saga at any time. She waits there and can do nothing else, not even die or let go.

The damaging power of revenge to oneself and others in amply on display, but the game is not without its hopeful side. For with revenge the game also presents the opportunity of redemption. Following the standard story arc of wuxia genre stories, the protagonist who was disrespected will train, learn and get stronger before presenting oneself before those who had rejecting her. Often these skills are then used to defeat one's nemesis. In the eyes of her clan, Nariko is redeemed, despite being female, by becoming the warrior of prophecy. Her inner strength shines forward and how she is viewed is changed in their eyes.

In Nariko's eyes her father achieves redemption. When she was a baby and deemed cursed he wanted to kill her and be rid of her. This secret comes to light during the event so the game and forgiveness seems beyond Nariko at this point. But Kai's injuries forcing her to return for their help and the heartfelt apology in face insurmountable forces she sees fit to fight by his side and forgive him. Then, at the final battle, Nariko achieves redemption for herself. The final sub-chapter of the game is called Redemption and here is the final stage of the boss fight against Bohan as the Raven King. Once beaten a cutscene plays with the raven abandoning him and his son, Roach, coming up to him and protecting his father in his arms, begging Nariko not to deal the final blow. After everything this man has put her and her clan through, glowing with divine energy, she relents. She has achieved total victory, killing Bohan would serve no purpose other than her revenge, but she lets go of her hate and allows him to go off peacefully. However, even in redemption, she cannot recover the piece of her lost to the sword only move on, just as her father cannot undo the wounds he caused her only heal them, or Kai recover her innocence only grow up to her new responsibility of protecting the Heavenly Sword. Even in redemption the damage still exists and the pieces are still lost.

All of these themes are in the story and the narrative elements, but here Ninja Theory's combat systems work and don't fly in the face of what they are trying to do with the rest of the game. Here they are necessary and add resonance that improve the base components to greater meaning in conjunction with each other. This is the type of thing that Ninja Theory is capable of and to fall so far with Enslaved.]]></content:encoded>

One feature of <em>Final Fantasy Type-0 </em>that will likely anger a few traditionalists is the game's secret mission feature. Ace, Queen, and their friends are such studious residents of the Peristerium School of Magic that as long as you put your PSP to sleep instead of turning it off when you're not playing, they will continue to gain ability points as they hit the books after a long day of you guiding them through their adventures.

There's probably something to be said about games becoming nigh automated here, but for people with not nearly enough time like me it's time to rejoice! This is fantastic! I'll get to enjoy a Final Fantasy game and possibly <em>finish</em> it while its still relevant! <em>Type-0</em> may be the first <em></em>game in the franchise I'll finish since <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>. All fellow residents of the guild of gamers with no time are invited to join me in glorious celebration! We shall gather with our PSPs in sleep mode and complete the less exciting tasks of our lives together in harmony!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier today, 2D Boy announced that their smash hit World of Goo will soon be available for Android phones and tablets.

"We’re just working out the final kinks in the machinery. More info on GooDroid soon."

The game has been extremely successful on both the Wii and ios devices because of its unique motion control system and engaging gameplay. While 2D Boy has made it clear that there will be no sequel in the works, they have worked to make the game available on a multitude of formats.

		<title>Valve&#039;s Steam Voted Easiest Platform for Indies</title>

In a recent survey of 100 indie studio’s, 64% said that Valve’s Steam service was the easiest to develop for, thanks to both the tech itself and the support from Valve. However, 28% claim developing for Steam was “so-so” while 8% claim that it’s difficult. None claimed it was excruciating.

After Valve came Facebook, Apple iOS, and Google Android, in that order. Facebook with a 57% “very easy” and 47% “so-so”. Apple with 54% “very easy” and 46% “so-so”. No developer found either “difficult” or “excruciating”. Google pulled 27% “very easy”, 45% “so-so”, 18% “difficult”, and 9% “excruciating”.

Following them, came the three console publishers: Sony(PSN), Nintendo(WiiWare), and Microsoft(XBLA), in that order. The majority of developers found developing for PSN “so-so”, Wiiware “difficult”, and XBLA “excruciating”. Nobody found working with Microsoft to be “very easy”.

After them came cell phone carriers, with 57% saying developing for them is excruciating, and 43% said it was difficult.

This data was <a href="http://2dboy.com/2011/10/03/xbla/">collected by Ron Carmel</a>, co-founder of independent studio 2D Boy, developer of <em>World of Goo</em>

This news is re-enforced by past stories, like <em>Cthulu Saves the World</em> <a href="//nightmaremode.net/2011/07/steam-power-cthulu-saves-the-world-thrives-on-pc-8628/”">”thriving” on the PC</a>, indie developers <a href="//www.develop-online.net/news/38797/Indies-are-turning-their-back-on-XBLA”">turning their backs</a> on XBLA, and gives a bit of weight to Team Meat’s decision to <a href="//www.develop-online.net/news/38606/We-wont-work-with-Microsoft-again-Team-Meat”">never work with Microsoft again</a>. Seems the future is not looking too good for XBLA. If your an indie developer, Steam seems to be the way to go. Or if your dead-set on releasing on consoles, you'd be better off releasing on PSN.

		<title>When War Was Fun: A Battlefield 1942 Retrospective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s 2002, and I’m gazing in rapt attention at my monitor, a friend looking over my shoulder. It’s 1943, and I’m piloting a fully-loaded landing craft towards the Japanese air base on Wake Island. I wince as a Japanese fighter zooms overhead, but he seems more interested in dogfighting than dive-bombing my defenseless bucket o’ troops. As we near the shore, my fear turns to excitement. “64 players – and they’re all <em>real people</em>,” I explain to my friend excitedly. “No bots.” As we storm the beach, I repeat variations of this statement as some sort of mantra. Maybe if I say it enough times, I’ll believe it.

It seems silly now, but at the time it was mind-blowing. Only 2001’s Tribes 2 had been designed for so many players, and while brilliant in its own right it tended to devolve into a chaotic swarm of jetpack-clad warriors engaging in ritualized aerial battles. And while the Tribes series popularized the integration of vehicles into the first-person shooter, they only ever filled a support role. Battlefield 1942 combined the vehicles of Tribes and the class system of Team Fortress to create a combined-arms combat game that encouraged coordinated team play. Its bombastic intro (complete with a surprisingly catch theme song) perfectly captured the sense of scope the game was going for, the feeling that the player was Part Of Something Bigger.

While teamed-based shooting had been around for a few years, it was still stuck in the Quake model, with each player given the same awesome destructive power and only skill and reflexes dictating the winner. BF 1942 combined an aggressive push towards specialization while allowing the player to constantly switch specializations; while you were stuck within your class until you died, the various vehicles and turrets allowed a player to switch their strengths to suit the situation. The result was a game as much about tactics as twitch-shooting. In clan games this meant an unprecedented level of top-down strategy, but even public servers featured an unusual level of team cohesion, in practice if not in intent. By introducing the Conquest “capture-and-defend-locations” game mode, it focused the armies towards specific goals while allowing freedom of movement, avoiding the “throw the soldiers into the grinder” approach of linear attack-and-defend games like Unreal Tournament’s Assault gametype and creating a natural convergence of forces.

These are the things that made Battlefield 1942 important. But they’re not why I fondly remember the game – and why, nine years later, nothing has really replaced it.

In our current glut of pseudo-realistic, intensely competitive shooters (thanks, Counterstrike!), it can be hard to remember that there was a time when such games were playful. Battlefield 1942 may have ostensibly taken place during a very serious war, but the flavor had more in common with Hogan’s Heroes than Saving Private Ryan. This was a game where people would load up jeeps with satchel charges and drive them into enemy tanks, where skilled pilots would frequently fly upside down just for the hell of it and morons would steer the team’s sole aircraft carrier onto an island. The proliferation of dedicated jeep-race maps and servers was inevitable.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJ5D63IRkU

This larger-than-life approach was reflected in the fact that the game rewarded mythic acts of daring even as it encouraged symbiotic teamplay. I can’t count the number of times I was shot down bombing an enemy base, only to parachute in, highjack one of their tanks, and wreak havoc.  In my proudest moments, I actually wrote down some battle accounts. I’ve still got one from an insane 20 minute kill streak during the Battle of the Bulge, in which I was the deciding factor in a German victory (go me?). It was the first and last FPS I played that regularly produced engaging stories. There were so many elements, so many possible combinations of strategies, objects, and unanticipated uses of the physics systems, that I could regularly surprise myself with a crazy new escape from death. This was the sort of emergent gameplay that sold Deus Ex embodied in a multiplayer title. Ask any BF1942 veteran about their “Battlefield stories” and they’ll get a distant look in their eyes and recount – in a manner disturbingly like an <em>actual</em> veteran – the time that they defended the last capture point from a squadron of fighters with nothing but a mobile artillery unit and a pistol. Some of these crazy techniques, like the LoopZook linked below, became part of the game’s framework, in the same way that rocket-jumping did with Quake and “skiing” did with Starsiege: Tribes. But while those techniques were incorporated into future incarnations of their respective series, developer DICE and publisher EA did their best to “clean up” Battlefield on its way to becoming a major franchise.

Even before Battlefield headed for consoles, features started being stripped away in the name of streamlining, as when naval combat was removed and aircraft carriers made immobile in 2005’s Battlefield 2. By the time DICE and EA had shifted to consoles as a lead platform, whole swaths of content were left on the cutting room floor. They seemed to be aiming for a “purer” experience with the new games, void of the “extraneous” elements that made the games more difficult for newcomers. When my landing boat finally hit the beach on Wake Island, I manually lowered the landing ramp to let my troops out. In Battlefield 1943, the downloadable game that remade four of Battlefield 1942’s twenty-two maps, troops exiting the landing craft were magically teleported outside of it. The lead designer explained that they removed the feature because it was “confusing” for new Battlefield 1942 players, who didn’t realize you had to lower the door at all. He was right, but by the time all such features were removed, the sequels had become something different.

In many ways, these sequels were better games. They vastly improved on the original’s clunky infantry combat, schizophrenic damage model (jeeps would regularly explode from 2-foot drops) and total lack of squad mechanics. But something was missing. Battlefield 2’s jets had an amazing flight model, but none of the romance of the ‘40s dogfights. Bad Company 2 was the most balanced and focused the series had ever been<strong>, </strong>but there was little room for experimentation outside of destroying buildings. The more polished the games got, the further they strayed from the sandbox play that characterized the original. It was the difference between playing with model airplanes and having a shell-shocked veteran tell you that war is hell.

I’m not sure why creative play is no longer a focus of FPS games. Maybe it’s the extensive play-testing. Maybe it’s not deemed commercially viable. Maybe it’s simply a symptom of better technology with less exploitable loopholes. But for whatever reason, the torch has been passed. Where once you there were Tribes servers dedicated to building and Battlefield servers reserved for stunt flying, this cooperative goofing off has largely move to Minecraft and its rapidly spawned successors. In the modern online FPS, all you do is shoot things; and while the mechanics of the shooting keep getting better, all I can see is a genre racing towards congruence, forgetting the time when war was nothing but a setup for pure, unadulterated fun.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You're right that Halo played a big part, but it was really the second wave. Battlefield 1942, for instance, had its vehicles well integrated into its design before Halo ever came out (as did its predecessor, Codename Eagle). Sales are a good measure of how much a design influences players, but not so much with developers; if a game doesn't sell very well and yet tons of game developers play it, it can have a huge influence anyway (this was the case with Ultima Underworld leading iD to make Doom, for instance). It really gets down into how you want to define the world "popularize" - there are games that did it before Tribes that are considerably more obscure than that series, and games that did it after that are more popular. But I'll stick with my statement, because by the time Halo came out that ball was already rolling.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Your post raised a sense of nostalgia that I've searched for quite some while now. I have been trying to figure out why the new games are becoming increasingly dull, mostly playing around a simple gameplay gimmick and fancier graphics than the prequel. Although there are a few jewels that shine quite prettily, the influx of soil is terrible. What happened to developers? Are they just giving up on their dream games? Or is it the publishers fault for trying to be more and more politically correct to attract the acceptation of the public or what? Even Molyneux has been doing mostly Fable series. 

Some developers try to shock you or just give in to the glorification of military porn (CoD, MoH etc.) being too serious with their franchise. Square-Enix and Bethesda are two parties with quirky humor and quite different take on things, but they're just a few specks of light in a universe of black holes.

When everything the new games have to offer in terms of out of ordinary gameplay are laid bare on the ground, they just simply pale in comparison with the old classics. How come, in this time of indie games awakening, such mechanics are completely forgotten? Or have I been playing the wrong games? Minecraft is fun to play with, but it's intentionally fun and it's free mechanics shape much of the fun that comes out of it, but I don't know almost any games now that didn't try to restrict the way you can play them. They're all just tunnel shooters with flimsy plots these days. The consolification of games brands has mostly just zombified many good series into the point of cold dullness. :( 

You spoke about the trending "purifying" of games, in my terms that's very much the same as "blanding". I dislike the polished games that have been overdone, it's a bit like your favourite band's new album that has been tuned and tuned until they pass the line where it's just too refined that it loses it's soul. "Mainstream games" are losing theirs. 

Indie games are working hard on countering that, but some are just built around super-simple and straightforward gameplay and some particular graphical style which isn't really enticing either. On the other end of the spectrum the definition for indie games seems to be "insanely difficult". They have loads of graphics assets and might be addictive, but they too lack the surprising factor that old games had. Super Meat Boy, Bit.Trip games, VVVVV to mention few. VVVVV is about exploration, but you get to know all of its features with half an hour gameplay. Meat Boy I've only played in the original flash version, haven't bought it because I know I won't like the grinding aspect of it. Bit.trip games are simple and have nice style, but there's just nothing there that would make me want to play them. Take Commander Keen for example, secret messages, hidden areas that are not hinted in any way, fancy styles, colorful graphics (like the technicolor movies vs. contemporary sand/dark filters). 

Man.. I don't usually write in this style. Haven't written in like 10 years.. Thanks for the good trip to the past. Waiting for Thief 4.]]></wp:comment_content>

Meat Boy I've only played in the original flash version, haven't bought it because I know I won't like the grinding aspect of it. Bit.trip games are simple and have nice style, but there's just nothing there that would make me want to play them. Take Commander Keen for example, secret messages, hidden areas that are not hinted in any way, fancy styles, colorful graphics (like the technicolor movies vs. contemporary sand/dark filters). 

Man.. I don't usually write in this style. Haven't written in like 10 years.. Thanks for the good trip to the past.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I feel ya. Something that made me really depressed when doing some memory-refreshing for this piece: EA released 6 free maps in the years following the release of this game, all of them good. They'd never do that today - the game would ship with less maps to start with and they'd charge you for the rest.

That said, there are still games being released every year that push the boundaries - there are definitely indie games that are overly simplistic in their mechanics or old-school-for-the-sake-of-being-old-school, but there are others that have really surprised me. Atom Zombie Smasher, for instance, isn't really like anything I've ever played, and it uses its mechanics to make the atmosphere. But there is definitely a feeling that games are narrower, even when they're grandiose and innovative - Heavy Rain comes to mind. Very different, I love that it's there, but there isn't a huge amount of freedom to it, though I suppose that's the nature of adventure games.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I remember one match on Wake Island. It was when I made my first online friend.

I joined in the middle of the match, was on the Axis side. Our team was pushing up the North side of the island. I spawned on the ship, which a player moved north and closer to shore so we could get there faster. Well, one of our team-mates got stuck in the south-western portion of the map. He was dog-fighting, and charged the enemy plane and ejected right before they crashed.

Anyway, he landed WAAAY out into the ocean, and called for help. Well, I took a landing craft, and starting heading for him. I circled around the right side of the island, somehow sneaking by all of the enemy team in a damn landing craft. I got to the team-mate. Well, he was grateful, and I asked where he wanted to go. He didn't mind, so I decided we should take the southern strip of the island while the main forces were occupied on the north strip.

We landed at the far south end, and ran to the nearest point. Capped it without any resistance. We then took a jeep, and sped on over to the next one. The enemy did notice, but it was only like two people, who we dispatched easily. We then took the second point on the southern island.

It was at this point that the enemy finally noticed us fully and quite a few people and a tank were coming our way. Out-manned, out-gunned, and pinned down, we were stuck. It was at that point we looked at each other, both nodded, and then charged the enemy.

We failed, spectacularly. But we managed to get the enemy to split their forces, which let our main force in the north move into the airfield and take it.

Made my first online friend that day. We still talk occasionally.

Good times man, good times...

The newer battlefield games are a much more "controlled" experience. Which may not be bad in and of itself, but it caused the franchise to lose the sense of wonder and fun it once had.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">I was fortunate enough to have a small amount of overlap with the now endangered species known as arcade cabinets. Mind you, I’m not so old that I got to marvel at the majesty of their golden age, but some of my misspent youth was spent in some of the last true arcades before the mass extinction hit. I was a picky little bastard about the games I liked. I was all about twitch and go games largely based on instinct for the first quarter and memorization for whatever quarters I could get before my mom cut me off. Hated </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">Donkey Kong Jr. </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">but loved </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">Galaga </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">and any </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">Metal Slug </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">games I could find. Of course I loved the side scrolling </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">Simpson’s </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">beat-em-ups and a weird fighting game with a Pepsi themed fighter that I sometimes worry I dreamed up, but those are not applicable here.</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">If </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">Xotic </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">had a time machine, it would drop its RPG elements in favor of a power-up system and launch itself back into a cabinet to munch quarters. Its a shooter that plays like an arcade game with combo counters, multipliers, and level designs that demand replays; a game all about the almighty high score. Right now I am writing this seething at whatever imperceptible mistakes I managed to make that left me ranked #56 instead of #1 on my best level. Sure, it feels good to be above several thousand other people, but those 55 people above me are all that matter. Now that I have maxed out my weapon and character levels, I am driven by a need to revisit those levels and secure my rightful place atop the ranking system. This is the same sickness that drove me to play the same song in </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">Audiosurf </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">fifty times compels me.</span>

[caption id="attachment_12127" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="What do you see? I see combos waiting to happen."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00024.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12127 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00024-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

<div><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">This high score addiction comes wrapped up in a package a bit more dense then your typical arcade game, such as those RPG elements I mentioned. You play as a creature created to drive back an evil being of pure energy called The Orb. This Mr. The Orb grew bored as a god-like being of ultimate power, and decided to ravage planets for fun. Leaving the planets covered in a corruption that takes the form of red pulsing scabs, floating brains left behind to monitor the planet, lots of glowing items that are worth points, and a variety of baddies who all want to shoot you. By shooting everything you possibly can you gain points, by collecting everything shiny you gain points, by hunting down all the hidden brains you get points, and by going as fast and efficiently as you can you get points. Wait a second, I was talking about those RPG elements! Damn you, high score addiction!</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">Among all those delicious, delectable, and desirable points you also earn yourself skill point rewards for completing levels and challenges. You can use these to upgrade your characters four aspects, each three times. You can upgrade energy levels, which are ammo for primary and secondary weapons. It's a recharging bar but upgrades increase bar size and charge speed. You could upgrade your health bar, allowing you to take more bullets in the pursuit of high score glory. Armor is another good choice, as it reduces the amount of damage each hit you take does with each level you pump into it. Lastly you can upgrade your ability to absorb glowy things on the levels from larger distances, glowy things like health, energy, and, of course, points. Each of these four aspects are useful and work in conjunction with the other three, making the order you upgrade them change how you approach a level. Of course you could always spend these skill points on your living symbiotic gun so it can shoot all kinds of neat things at baddies, scabs, and brains in the levels.</span>

[caption id="attachment_12110" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="I named my living gun Gunther, and we are pals."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00007.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12110 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00007-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

<div><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">Your living gun is your only companion, unless you count the creepy synthesized voice of the narrator. The gun looks like a massive bug you shoved your arm inside of, and its appearance changes to reflect the weapon you're currently squeezing out of its face. If you set the little cutie up for long range, a proboscis that shoots sniper like lasers rolls out of its mouth. Want it to shoot smaller, exploding bugs that home in on enemies, and you will see those little buggers riding on its back. It's a nice visual cue for the various weapons. Despite the alien names the weapon modes have, you will be familiar with most if you have a background in shooter. You have a standard fire that costs no energy, a sniper round that is high in energy use, a shotgun like mode that’s great for short range and terrible for long, homing missiles, a debilitating electrical shock, various grenade like items, and a larger high damage missile that doesn’t home. These can all be upgraded three times, just like the character traits.</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">This variety is nice, but it is unfortunately crippled a bit by a small limitation to key binding options. This complaint won’t apply to everyone, but for players who depend on the scroll wheel to handle weapon changes or really like to use those extra buttons on gaming mice, it will be a frustration for sure. I live and die by my mouse 4 and 5 buttons in most fast paced games. They are easily accessed by my thumb and are the quickest bindings I can memorize. Changing my primary weapon with the mouse wheel is </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial;font-style: italic">all I know </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">in every shooter I have ever played. So when I found out I couldn’t bind the scroll wheel or my extra mouse buttons I knew I was in trouble. I just can’t swap weapons fast enough to really utilize them efficiently, and binding them to keys just means leaving my precious WASD home and that makes me both sad and worse at a particular level then 55 other people in the world. I am a firm believer that if a game is going to be developed for the PC, then it should allow full control customization; anything less then that is just infuriating. (The mouse wheel complaint has been patched away for the Steam version!)
</span>

[caption id="attachment_12131" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="I imagine feeding him bits of enemies to encourage these evolutions."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00028.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12131 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00028-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

<div><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">Thankfully though this is the only complaint I can lay at this games feet. The level designs are varied and range from pure horizontal corridors to open environments that are nice and vertical. The vertical levels shine in particular as they encourage creative use of one of my favorite mechanics in the game: solid holograms. You can rely on the environment for cover, and you can also deploy shimmering barriers in front of yourself. If you deploy these barriers while your airborne they will become instant platforms for your to scale into the air on. While they are fun and useful in combat, my love for them comes from how they impact level routes as you perfect a run.</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">Hovering crystals litter levels, and if you collect groupings of them in one jump they come with a bonus. This really makes you think on your feet as you try to run and gun at the same time through these levels. You could come back for those floaty guys, but if you manage to hop on your platforms as you go, shooting at the ground based targets the entire time, its worth far more points in the end. Of course being up in the air often exposes you to all kinds of gunfire, so sometimes you need to gun down a few baddies, loop back around for a point multiplier, then begin shooting some scabs for chain reaction combos as you climb your platforms to leap off of and collect groupings of crystals for air combos.</span>

[caption id="attachment_12124" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="This will take some consideration..."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00021.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12124 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00021-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

<div><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">That’s what this game is all about, really. The first time you play a level its about exploration over speed, as you need to know where the enemies, the power ups, and the hidden targets are. Repeat </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">plays</span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial"> of the level will see you looking to string combos for as long you can, grab multipliers at just the right time for maximum payoff, and collecting the combat based powerups just before turning a corner and confronting the more dangerous enemies on that map. Depending on how into this sort of formula you are, you can stay nice and entertained for several laps through the same level, each time constructing a more efficient system of completing everything for the most possible points.</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">Speaking of levels, the game is divided into four worlds, each world is comprised of several levels and challenge maps. Once you finish the first level of each world a branching path system opens and you can choose which levels to complete first, with each other offering a different amount of skill points as reward and a time to beat. Complete enough levels in a world to unlock the next world, for crazy people looking to finish the game for some reason as </span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial">opposed</span><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Arial"> to playing every possible level. I suppose it allows for players to bypass a particularly hard level in favor of leveling up some more and coming back to it later, but I wouldn't know about that. This offers just the right amount of levels, enough to be varied and keep the settings interesting, but not so many that you get overwhelmed thinking about replaying them all in pursuit of a better score.</span>

[caption id="attachment_12118" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Sometimes the baddies shoot back. This often makes me sad."]<a href="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00015.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12118 " src="http://nightmaremode.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-09-30_00015-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="346" /></a>[/caption]

<span style="font-family: Arial;color: #000000">This game is the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;color: #000000;font-style: italic">Trials 2 </span><span style="font-family: Arial;color: #000000">of the shooter genre. It's not about kill to death ratios, or levels brimming with enemies. It has no multiplayer component outside of a good old fashioned high score board. It's all about your own personal perfection, playing until you can’t do it any better, and then trying it again. Its not the most beautiful game in the world, though its not hard on the eyes either, nor is it the most complex of games with any kind of deep story telling. It has mechanics for you to master, and worlds for you to master them in. Its an old fashioned kind of game given a new coat of paint, and sometimes that can be a truly engaging experience. Or you just have a problem and this game is nothing more then a high score pusher, giving you another fix and secretly hoping to ruin your marriage. Either way, it's a thing of beauty.</span>]]></content:encoded>
