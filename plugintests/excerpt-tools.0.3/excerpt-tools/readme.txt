Change the default text and description of the excerpt box, add an excerpt box to pages and show a jQuery character counter and limiter.

== Description ==

First release of a simple plugin to enhance your use of the_excerpt() function. Allows you to change the default title and description of the excerpt box, add an excerpt box to pages and show a customizable jQuery character counter with the ability to limit the amount of characters. 

I designed this plugin for a site whose  magazine layout required the excerpt to be a precise length. The jQuery character counter from [Tom Deater](http://tomdeater.com/)  provides a user friendly way to limit the amount of characters while writing.
